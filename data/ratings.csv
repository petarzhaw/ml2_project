movies,"We are Patrick Wilson and James Wan from INSIDIOUS: THE RED DOOR. The new trailer is out now! Ask us anything! EDIT: Thank you so much Reddit! This was a blast. INSIDIOUS: THE RED DOOR in theaters July 7 - Patrick & James

Patrick Wilson here (u/InsidiousMovie). You may know me as Josh Lambert from the INSIDIOUS franchise, and I also starred in Aquaman and the Conjuring films. Yes, all of these were directed by James Wan. I DO work with others...just not as often.  I'm making my directorial debut in INSIDIOUS: THE RED DOOR, in which I also star.

And producer James Wan here – Founder/CEO of Atomic Monster, co-creator of INSIDIOUS and SAW franchises, THE CONJURING Universe, producer of M3GAN, director of AQUAMAN and FURIOUS 7 (among others!). Looking forward to your questions!

Music,"[UPDATE] r/Music Will Close on June 12th Indefinitely Until Reddit Takes Back Their API Policy Change [Previous Post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/141dpgz/rmusic_will_be_going_dark_from_june_1214_in/)

Hi All,

We will be making the subreddit private on June 12th indefinitely. You will not have access to the community until we open it back up to the public.

The reason for this decision is because we are protesting reddit's policy change for using their API. More details can be seen on this post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/).

The consequences can be viewed in this [Image](https://i.redd.it/zqptto18e34b1.jpg) - r/videos [Full Post](https://old.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/140vubs/why_is_rvideos_shutting_down_on_june_12th_how/).

[Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/) is the open letter if you would like to read and sign.
