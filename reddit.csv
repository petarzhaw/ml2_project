Warning to console RTS fans - Dont buy Company of Heroes 3 for full price,"Hello console RTS fans!

It has come to my attention that Company of Heroes 3 is releasing tomorrow on consoles. Since I know that many of you might not be on Steam, I came here to warn you. Company of Heroes 3 is severely unfinished and unpolished & lacks content, but its still being sold as an AAA title. 

I am not a veteran of the series, Ive only played COH2 before COH3, but I can tell its not an improvement in the series and most certainly and most importantly NOT worth 60e/£/$. As it is now, the game resembles a Early Access title and its post (PC) launch updates have been extremely slow and lacking. Relic just fired 120 members from their team, which according to them ""helps them focus on their core franchises"". If we are being realistic, it certainly wont make them update & fix the game any faster.

Whats wrong with the game, you may ask? **Its buggy, the SP content is repetitive and boring, the AI is extremely bad and provides no challenge even at the hardest difficulty, the mechanics in the ""game-selling"" new ""dynamic"" ""strategic"" 4x map are straight up broken and lack impact and most importantly, the game has very few maps for the MP**. For 3vs3 theres 3 of them, out of which 1 is a poorly revisioned 4vs4 map that is extremely unbalanced and for 4vs4 theres only 2 maps! Theres also a bunch of bugs that can decide a match. On top of these, the game also lacks very basic MP game functionalities like **surrender button & leaver penalties** (the lack of these leads to people quitting games early on, before the match is actually decided), **reconnecting possibility, replay feature, ability to see which player is who** (theres color codes but no names) etc. 

If you dont want to be a part of the problem that is devs & publishers getting away with releasing **unfinished garbage for AAA prices, then adding microtransactions with the first ""major"" update** after the failed launch, dont buy the game at full price. (The MCTs are skins, grossly over-priced with a predatory pricing system) I know there arent a lot of RTS games for consoles, but I highly recommend patience in this case. Its also important to note that Relic team members continuously lied during the dev't to sell their game to the fans of the franchise. COH3 will be sold at -50% or even bigger discount before the end of the year. Personally I feel like the game is worth 20e at max atm and I have played the campaign through with the highest difficulty and MP extensively enough.

Dont want to take my word for it? [Here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677280/Company_of_Heroes_3/#app_reviews_hash) is a link to the Steam page reviews. This is not a review bombing, these are peoples actual opinions on the games state. Note how the recent reviews are even worse than the initial **54% recommend**, this is due to the poor reception of after-launch support, or lack of it. Relic has kept insisting that they plan on developing the game for years, but their actions & lack there of and lies during the dev't lead me and a big part of the community to doubt it. The game might get better at some point, but again, its not even close to being worth a full AAA price at this time.

The game came out and... meh, admittedly I was underwhelmed. Almost disappointed. Not that I didn't enjoy it, but I do feel like I had more fun during the speculation and marketing period than I did during and after the actual game.

Do Ubisoft games lacking structure help or harm the games?,"I just played Gat Out of Hell for the first time and I've noticed something with Volition games. It's a sandbox but the kind where everything the game has to offer is unlocked at the start of the game. Its design philosophy ""Here's the whole game. I don't really give a shit what you do. Just pick whatever looks fun and do it."" 

I've noticed Ubisoft games are somewhat like this. Sure, you unlock sections of the map as you progress through the main story, but everything in that district/island/city is fully available to you. E.g I'm replaying Black Flag right now and I completed all the bonus stuff in Havana (assassin contracts, collectables) before I even did any of the story there. Just done the same in Nassau. Done a playthrough of Far Cry 4 in around November and I remember completely wiping the south island clean of things to do before I even did any of the main story on it. 

Personally, I'm conflicted. It's great that you can just do whatever you want in any order you want. But this comes at the cost of quality of the missions. Rather than a side story to do, it's really just a glorified diversion. Diversions are fun, but the don't feel important. It's more like a minigame than a side campaign. I wish developers were like ""Okay, so we know exactly which order the player is going to do these missions in, because we've forced that structure into the missions. So because they're linear, we can flesh out the story a bit more"". It would also be great if there was less things to do, but more meaningul things. I'd rather have 5 lengthy, fully fleshed out side activities than 19 diversions that is just go to x rescue y hostages rinse repeat. 

Tl;dr I like the freedom, but the freedom is a double edged sword because lack of structure = less focus on plot. What do you think?",gaming,0,1685417111.0,0.5

Xbox vs PlayStation: controller edition,"I will preface this by saying that I have always had an Xbox, from the original that I won in a hitting derby when I was 8 in little league and still proudly play it today.

I also have a ps4, and love it to death. The Sony exclusives are some of the best games I’ve ever played, but I struggle to go back to them instead of turning on my box. 

Why, you may ask?

The controller. I don’t know if it’s just that the Xbox controller is more ergonomic, fits my hands better, or if the PS controller is just bad. 

I have never enjoyed the feel of a PS controller, even playing games I love on Xbox feel foreign on PlayStation. Not because of the buttons, just the entire feel of the controller. It doesn’t sit correctly in my hands, the triggers feel off, it just feels unnatural.

I feel that I am just not built for video games and no matter how hard I try I can’t change that.,This is more of a thought and a way to promote discussion. So I have been playing video games for half my life and I play for hours daily. I like hard games like elden ring but I can’t ever get good at them.

Artistically I love it, the transitions, the level design, the story is great as it directly confronts the fact that Sebastian has PTSD from his own life but also the events of the first game, and having him confront said trauma is, in my opinion, better than any writing we’ve got from RE.

Hypothetical Question: How Much Would You Pay For What Access?,"Let’s say that every upcoming or recently successful AAA title was repriced in the following way:

- 6 months to release, game costs an additional 6 times release cost (which we’ll call 40 for ease) currency doesn’t really matter here, so let’s say Monopoly notes?  So at 6 months to go it’s 280 monobuckos.

 - 5 months to release its 5 times release cost. So 240 monopolonies

Etc etc down to release cost of the game. 

How do you think this would change players spending habits for games and when they buy them? Do you think more people would buy “early” and if so, how far before release do you see being the most popular?  

If you think people wouldn’t pay early, what about a similar post release system. That after a set period of time the game drops a set percentage, going up to being free after however many years. In this scenario; would “free to play” become more common with people waiting potentially years for titles to enjoy the system. I know I have strayed towards waiting for a while after release to see reviews and hopefully a sale for a few titles, I just don’t know how this system may effect that awareness/ frugality. 

I know this does happen to an extent with sales, reductions etc, but I’m talking if you knew that “4 years after release this game will be exactly 15 monopennies, and in 6 years it would be free” would you wait and if so how long? 

I’ll add that early access in this wouldn’t be testing etc, the game will not change based on feedback from Early Access players. You’re literally just getting exactly what you would get at any point over the next 6 months, you but now you’re setting a potentially ridiculous price point for yourself.

"4k 27"" monitor or 43"" TV for PS5 + PC setup?","Hey everyone, I'm curious what everyone here thinks I should do.

I just recently order a PS5 online but my screen setups right now kind of suck. I have a 24"" 1080p 144hz monitor at my desk which isn't adequate for PS5 gaming. I don't play competitive games anymore and I don't work at a desk so having a HFR isn't that useful for me anymore.

There's a pretty decent local listing for an LG monitor which is 27"", 4k, IPS for around 180 USD. I'd love to make use of 4k, and I think at arms length that this would be the best option. The pixel density would also be really good. 

I've also been toying with the idea of getting a 43"" TCL TV which I could also obtain for the same price. Though I'm worried it'll be a little too huge, and potentially be worse for browsing. But leaning back in my chair, this may be more immersive for gaming. 

I have a couch setup but it's 8 feet to the TV, and I'd need a 65"" TV which will be out of my budget.

I enjoy exploring Hyrule’s basement more than the Attic,"Why do I call them that? Partly because when the TOTK game came out, I was half delirious with sickness and couldn’t be bothered to remember their actual names. But mostly because that’s what they are:

A basement is dark, spooky, filled with ghosts and other creepy things. Descending into them is a process as you seriously debate with every step if the item you need to get is actually worth it.

An attic is cramped, and filled with old, broken things that hardly anyone alive can remember is there, but you can spend hours exploring the old forgotten stuff because it’s cool and full of nostalgia, even if the nostalgia isn’t yours. There’s only one way into the attic, and it’s kind of a pain to access, so you wait until you have enough time to go there in case you get stuck in a nostalgic trip.

But I like the basement better. There’s something exciting about not being able to see too far ahead, and having huge, dark monsters suddenly appear in the fringes of the light you do have as you exclaim “What is THAT?!” Plus I like the music better. The attic music is too relaxing. The basement music keeps you on edge.

Which games of different gernes have the best combat?,"Personally, Outriders would have been my modern day Mass Effect if not for the input delay and heat-seeking-psychic enemies making the cover system useless. Activating powers that recharge in less than 10 seconds was something I wanted to see more of.

For FPS, Call of Duty always felt good when it comes to aiming, though I like Destiny's overall idea of being a FPS ""Mass Effect.""

Bayonetta has my favorite melee combat as far as character hack n slash games go, especially since you can bounce between quick and heavy attacks for different combos. The Yakuza games kinda has a few pet peeves of mine, like drip feeding basic moves to linear combo inputs.

As much as I hate the trolling and obnoxiousness in how difficulty works (death mechanics mainly), From Soft's games actually gives you a full kit of attacks without having to upgrade to unlock a ""kick."" One of my biggest pet peeves with melee combat in most games today.

Yakuza 7 is the only turn based RPG I played since Final Fantasy 10, and it's not at all my favorite type of gameplay, but Y7 made it fun. To actually have a physics system in a turn based game was insane to me. Otherwise, I hate RNG in combat in general. I hate enemies and allies moving around at random, but it was cool.

What‘s the current situation about EA Sports and the new Fifa game?,"Hello,

i remember Fifa23 was the last Fifa game from EA Sports. I also remember the Fifa said they want to launch „the best new fifa game next season“ and EA Sports also want to male a new soccer game.

So does anybody know what‘s the current situation for the next soccer game (also who can use original names of players, clubs and so in)?",gaming,0,1685285788.0,0.25
Important gaming mechanic advances over the years,"Hello everyone, 

Yesterday and today so far I had been struggling to find a new game to play, but when looking through my games library on PS4 an hour or so ago, I discovered that I had Red Dead Revolver. The game where the series started from. Loved it on PS2 and thought it would be cool to get the platinum and then must have forgotten all about the game.

So I downloaded it and straight away the old nostalgia kicked in. It obviously doesn't move as smooth as the games of today, or even the games that released later in the series. But what really stuck me was the shooting. Because your character is in the center part of the screen, the people you're often trying to shoot are blocked by your own character. All of a sudden I remembered how Resident Evil 4 changed 3rd person shooting with its over the shoulder view. The next thing was sensitivity and no ability to change it, again something that came along with modern gaming. 

At this point I deleted the game as I just couldn't play it. It also reminded me how limited gaming was until it started making these big changes for the better and why I enjoy gaming more now than I ever did. 

What are some of the mechanic and other finely tuned features in the gaming do you appreciate when compared to the early years of gaming?",gaming,16,1685192091.0,0.75

Anyone else feel like this? Any other games that do this in a totally annoying way?

P.S. Sometimes, fighting two on one makes sense and is awesome (e.g., Ornstein and Smough), but what I'm complaining about is lazy boss-making (i.e., just have him fight two of the exact same thing at once later in the game)",gaming,1,1685243796.0,0.52
Hall effect controller for PS5+switch,"All of my controllers drift. Switch pro controller, dualsense, dualshock 4, joycons.

I need a controller with something like hall effect joysticks, which means they are much less likely to drift.

I have looked online and found the guilykit controller that shortcircuit (the yt channel) reviewed, but it doesn't ship to my country, also it doesn't support playstation.

I need something like a battle beaver, but without the regular joysticks.

Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated.

How to play metal gear acid 2 (MGA2) on PPSSPP without lag on Android TV?,"Using the default settings, I was able to play MGA with relatively no issues (only when putting on NVGs from Marionette Owl card, it would lag pretty bad).

In MGA2 however, after choosing what card to port from MGA, straight away, the dialogue is VERY laggy and looks like the game is playing in 0.125x speed. No black bars or rainbow lines, just very choppy dialogue text and I can't even get past the first text box lol. The emulation takes ages to respond as well, when bringing up the save state menu (in order to go back to PPSSPP home menu, as the lag is unbearable). Never really had these problems in MGA.

Should I just follow everything in this tutorial? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bXsqSkdmvo4 

Or are there specific PPSSPP settings that are best for MGA2; like what ACTUALLY will make a difference to fix the lag? I read stuff such as;

- Lowering spline quality such as high to medium or low may help.
- 'must do frameskipping to make it playable', but the tutorial above does not do this.
- 'change the I/O timing method', to simulate UMD delays?
- 'instead of native device resolution, match the display resolution to 1x, 2x or 3x with the rendering resolution'?
- 'don't do skip buffer effects, as you may get black bars' (also mentioned in the tutorial above).

White Men Can't Jump (2023) .... WTF.,"I loved the original growing up. It's one of those movies where I watch it every time it's on or if i randomly come across it on streaming. 

The thing about it is the plot is crap. The chemistry between Woody, Snipes, and Perez is what MAKES the movie. 

I knew 2023 would be crap, but i just couldnt help myself. HOLY FUCK. I don't know that the fuck they were thinking. 

The white dude was actually a fuckin nerd/bitch, not just pretending to be one. Imagine Woody complaining about a vegan menu in the OG or using ""homophobic chicken sandwiches"" as an insult.

Credit to the white dude tho, he at least TRIED to act like Woody. The black guy and the perez character had the personality of a paper bag. 


It's basically the same movie, just done worse in every single conceivable way. 

This kinda movie also doesnt work in 2023 where everyone can be racist af to the white guy but he can NEVER give it back.

Edit: Also, instead of the jimi argument In this one the white dude asks the black dude if he listens to any white music. The black dude says he ""fucks around with ed sheeran"". The white dude hugs him and says ""I'm in love with the shape of you.""

Then the black dude invites the white guy to his kids birthday party and the guy says ""That sounds FIRE! I fuck around with kids""

Spoilers ahead.

Man so I really enjoyed Nope, but I think my tolerance for gore and horror has really decreased as I've grown.  The monkey scene, and the scene following the rodeo just pop into my head occasionally and I just sit there kinda nauseated and just remember how disturbing those scenes were.

I think they did a great job of making it feel real, not so obsurd it's funny like some of the franchises like Saw or slasher flicks.  Also, having lived in an area of the world with tornadoes, it really reminded me of those.  It's some powerful force of nature that just dumps it's waste on you when it's done consuming everything you love.

Watched The Sandlot tonight with family to celebrate the beginning of Summer.,"It is such an amazing movie that perfectly captures the freedom of both childhood and baseball especially when one takes into consideration that the film is set during the innocence of the early 1960s. I especially loved how the dialogue from all of the kids felt natural and older Scotty narrating it ala Wonder Years style was the cherry on the cake.

Jacobs Ladder (1990) is my new favorite movie!!,"Just like the title says, I cant believe I slept on this movie for so long!! I've heard about it forever but sort of skipped it, or saved it, for whatever reason. 

I wasn't expecting the weird surreal nightmare quality of the film to be the ENTIRE film. Aside from that it also struck me as almost an ""every frame a painting"" type film with a beautiful vibrant look and tone that felt super atmospheric and unnerving where I wasn't sure what horror to expect next, but also couldn't look away. 

I can also recall several scenes/set pieces VERY strongly, the opening subway scenes, the scene with the guy in the bar, the scenes with the car trying to chase him, his creepy girlfriend fucking the literal devil then becoming possessed, the hospital sequence... 

Lots to enjoy in performances too from the amazing leads even to seeing Macaulay Culkin and the guy from Sienfeld pop up briefly!

All of the in camera effects were really incredible too especially the use of lighting and smoke effects and the way they'd frame characters in silhouette or through cracked mirrors. It was just very thoughtful and clever. 

The vibe of the movie was amazing too I was sort of confused why it looked and felt like Taxi Driver when it was a 90s movie then realized it's ""technically"" a period piece of his MEMORIES of 190s New York which makes perfect sense. I also love when more modern stuff FEELS like a period piece so convincingly, like Come and See or GOODFELLAS feeling like they actually were filmed decades ago and you almost don't question it.

I loved the more metaphysical elements and the heartbreaking ""Owl Creek"" style ending left me feeling really depressed but it was also beautiful and made me think about life in a profound way I wasn't expecting. 

It definitely transcended being just another horror movie and it's up there for now with my other favorites THE WAILING, and HEREDITARY!!!",movies,267,1685382278.0,0.83
"To Live And Die In L.A., wow!","I watched this movie a long time ago and while I liked it, it seemed very by the numbers with great cinematography. Actual plot is a hot head cop goes rogue to avenge his partner killed two days from retirement(lol).

Just watched it again and I don't know how I overlooked it before but the ending reveals that almost every single side and stock character had their own schemes and were manipulating and playing the protagonist, and also the antagonist was pretty amazing!  In fact the protag and antag honestly seem pretty dumb in hindsight!

I can't remember another movie that ends with the reveal both the protag and antag were just being played for fools, often deservedly by people they were coercing into sex or were a connected lawyer they threatened with death.",movies,43,1685418345.0,0.8
Does anyone avoid rewatching a movie because you know/feel it won't be as good as you remembered?,"Or have a movie they regret rewatching because it didn't hold up to your memory of it?

Probably 10 or so years ago, I saw The Dark Knight for the first and only time, and it has been one of my favourite movies ever since. A few months ago, I was rewatching a lot of movies I liked and cutting down my to-watch list when I decided to finally rewatch it. After finishing it, I was sort of confused, not by the movie, but by how much I was overall just disappointed. It felt like despite my memory of the movie still being pretty accurate, watching the actual scenes again took away all the magic or nostalgia and left what was a husk of what I was expecting. I found a lot of just stupid and didn't enjoy some parts of it at all. The opening scene is still really good, though.

While I'm not entirely sure that movie fulfills on the promise of the trailer, I remember it being an effective and interesting film that I'm curious to revisit this year.

Was Daryl Hannah a mediocre actress or did the public underestimate her becase of her beauty?,"I know she got a lot of stick for WALL STREET, it wasn't as if she was doomed for the start due to how poorly written her character was, though I do concede she was terrible in STEEL MAGNOLIAS. Even I can't give her a pass for it. 

Nevertheless, in SPLASH and ROXANNE, I found her lovely and engaging and likable. It isn't like today where you're asked to like the leading lady. Back in the day, the leading lady won you over with her irresistible charm. 

Even though she played many kind and sweet ladies, Daryl Hannah was even more effective at playing the psychopath which is surprising when you know her from SPLASH. In the KILL BILL films, she's deadly and vicious as Elle Driver and in BLADE RUNNER, she uses her seemingly sweet person to keep us assuming Pris, the replicant, is harmless until we see her creepy smile or when she attacks Deckard by twisting his neck.",movies,76,1685368128.0,0.69
"The little seen 2000 effort ""Dinner Rush"" works as a top notch mob movie and an in-depth look at the running of a restaurant. A film guaranteed to make you raid the fridge after viewing.","Anyone familiar with the history of crime/mob films knows the importance of food/dining in them (see ""Goodfellas"" for one, where you learn how to slice garlic with a razor and that Vinnie puts too many onions in the sauce). But there's probably no mob movie where food plays as critical a role as ""Dinner Rush"", where the action takes place at a trendy Tribeca eatery run by Danny Aiello's Louis Croppa, who will tell anyone who asks that he doesn't have mob ties. However, on this night he's certainly got problems with them in the form of two hoodlums dubbed ""Black and Blue"" who previously committed a terrible act against someone close to Louis and now are aiming to muscle their way into an interest in his bookmaking operation and his restaurant. Louis will accept the former, but NEVER the latter.

Further complicating matters for Louis this evening are family issues. His son Nino (Edoardo Ballerini) has become a celebrity chef thanks to his unique dishes (much to the despair of his father, who just wants some good old Italian-style sausages and peppers) and is angling for a bigger say in running the restaurant. Meanwhile sous chef/surrogate son Duncan (Kirk Acevedo), who gladly makes Louis's favorite entrees, is a chronic gambler who happens to owe Black and Blue a hefty sum. And all this is happening on a busy night where the clientele includes an acerbic food critic (Sandra Bernhardt) who previously slept with Nino and who is here with a friend dubbed ""the food nymph"", a pompous art dealer (Mark Margolis aka Hector Salamanca) who is here with his entourage and is the walking embodiment of ""pretentious asshole"" and an enigmatic yuppie (John Corbett) who observes the events of the evening from his perch at the bar. (As he asks Jamie Harris's Triva-ace bartender, ""When did eating out become a Broadway show?"")

All this seems like a lot to take in, but the film expertly juggles all these subplots and characters and is never dull at a tidy 99 minute runtime. There's a first rate look at the behind the scenes running of a restaurant (especially how in the kitchen, a chef is the tyrant and his subordinates are slaves at their will) and the cast is uniformly excellent, anchored, unsurprisingly, by Aiello, who conveys both paternalistic warmth (Louis is an ideal boss) and quiet unflappability in the face of adversity. And there's a twist at the end that will probably catch you completely by surprise. It alone is worth the viewing

Basically, if you're looking for a movie option to go with dinner, this is an ideal choice. Because this movie WILL make you hungry.",movies,4,1685418036.0,0.59

John Wick 4 and Prime numbers,"Did a rewatch of the series and capped it off with a theater showing of Chapter 4 before it finally left theaters. I'm aware of some of the more obvious symbolism through the movies (Dante quotes, action movie homages, etc) but I'm curious of opinions on an aspect of one scene:

When John and the Marquis are drawing numbers to solidify the deal on how the duel will go, John wins the final two draws to decide for location and weapon. I noticed that all the cards John flipped were prime numbers (in order: 3, 19, then 23) and the Marquis' were not (8, 4, 18).

Bonus question: I remember a movie set in more modern times where a woman encounters a guy in some old ruins, and she calls out ""Saxon or Celt?"" Let me know if you remember the title of this one.",movies,15,1685392090.0,0.66

What's a Song You Know Because It Was Performed in a Movie?,"Today I was at the grocery store, and I heard ""Annie's Song"" by John Denver. I've never heard his version before, but the entire time I kept thinking ""I know this song..."" It wasn't till the end that I realized I know it because of My Best Friend's Wedding.

Another song is The Way We Were. I only know it because of Naked Gun 2 1/2.

So, what are songs you know because characters in a movie sang them?",movies,4,1685418480.0,0.59
What's the best movie you saw in a theatre during its original run?,"I say original run as opposed to, say, a classic at a midnight showing (in which case my answer would be The Godfather).

But, for a movie I saw on its original run, I'd say the best was Fight Club. It had me immediately, too. I can't think of another movie where I'd say the opening credits alone are worth seeing on the big screen.",movies,6,1685404382.0,0.6
Pitch the next crossover movie with two ongoing franchises/intellectual properties.,"It has to get people into the theater and you can build up to it if need be. Both franchises need to be currently established or ongoing with a minimum of two movies and no more than 10 years since the last one. Rebooted franchises need to follow the same criteria, two ongoing films 

I’ll start off by the most obvious choice
Transformers x Fast & Furious. The Fast franchise is so ludicrous and preposterous nowadays that it would actually work. While the transformers one is seeing a bit of reboot.

Imagine this, after the conclusion of Fast X part 2, Dom and his family have finally settled in only for a new threat to arrive. 

Decepticons! His family is called into to action because why the fuck not and in the ensuing chaos his dodge charger is blasted into oblivion and they must find a way to stop them.

Enter the auto bots who have followed them here to stop them from getting whatever McGuffin it is they are after this time. While Dom mourns the loss of family member he comes cross Bumbebee, now disguising himself as Dodge Charger Super Bee because again, why not. 

After a “wild speed” chase they bond and decide they need to work together to stop those pesky Decepticons. We get a bit of How to train your dragon montage as each fast character bonds with an auto bot as they learn to work together. 

The Decepticons have also decided to ally themselves with some humans (enter former Dom enemy seeking revenge) to carry out their nefarious needs.

As the clock winds down and we get two hours of comedy and explosions with some dodgy CGI, we get to the final battle. Just as Dom and Bee appear to be outnumbered, Optimus Prime shows up with the rest of the crew and Autobots. 

Than our ears and eyes are transcended into a greater bliss when Prime utters the words “Family, roll out!” Panning to Dom sporty the biggest shit eating grin.

If that’s not cinema, I don’t know what is.
Movie ends with the Autobots and the Fast crew enjoying a BBQ of course.

The Accountant (movie),"Enjoyed the first one because it’s an easy movie to follow along and not really have to be a detective to understand. There’s always the talk that there’s a 2 in the works. Would love to see that happen. Putting silly comments aside, I would be interested in seeing more of what Justine can do. It could continue to the one week later plot where Braxton don’t show up and is kidnapped or killed and or Dana gets in trouble and Chris saves her and finally kisses her.",movies,54,1685360062.0,0.72
Who was this background character in The Unknown Soldier (2017)?,"[Here is she.](https://i.imgur.com/z3u8tqN.png)

Who she might be? Does she even have a name? She only appears rarely in the movie and rarely talk. First time it was in a black car that was driving down the road with marching soldiers (she asked about for how long they are marching). The last time she could be seen was in the very end of the movie, when her bike broke and she asked a guy with horse drawn carriage to give her a ride, only to be attacked by soviet planes and tank in the next moments. She seems to managed to hide behind rock. But what happened to her after than? This is unknown.

So is she a nurse? Unlikely, as she could be seen in a hospital only 1 time, and she wasn't really healing anyone. She is definitely not a commanding officer, but she could be often seen in the company of high-command. She is neither a common soldier too, as she never carries any weapons.",movies,0,1685437904.0,0.4
Question for the ending of The Gentlemen (2019),"So at the end of the movie Mickey Pearson(Matthew McConaughey) is confronted by the Russians and is about to be killed by them but in a sudden turn, the toddlers call the coach(Colin Farrell) and say they are going to help resort the ""Mickey situation"" as they drive off in their van and shoot the Russians. But my question is: Were the toddlers intent to kill Mickey Pearson? No one knew about the Russians except for Fletcher(Hugh Grant) until he revealed it to Raymond Smith(Charlie Hunnam) but it was too late for Mickey as he got inside the car with the Russians, so when the toddlers were shooting the car not knowing the Russians were in the car, their intent was to kill him right? Why else would they want to shoot at Mickey Pearson's car and help resort the ""Mickey situation""? I always thought that wanted to help Mickey Pearson and the Coach by killing the Russians but know it seems clear that they wanted to help the Coach by killing Mickey Pearson but not knowing that the Russians were there they accidently saved Mickey Pearson by killing the Russians. Can someone correct me if I'm right please? I need clarity with this.",movies,6,1685399768.0,0.63
World Movies A-Z: Dominican Republic to Egypt,"This year as a challenge I have set myself that task of watching a film set in every country, in order to expand the context and languages of my movie watching in 2023. And also to have a bit of fun!

My main goal is to stick as close to alphabetical as possible, with the ideal film being set in, produced by, or at the very least primarily filmed in this country. I will be watching bad movies, great movies and everything in between with a aim to keep it diverse in genre and budget. I will give my thoughts on the movies I watch each week to catalogue this theatrical trip around the world.

Feel free to recommend any films from countries I have not yet watched or tell me what you have thought about a film if you happen to have seen it.

Dominican Republic - Jean Gentil: A drama of relieving quality after a long search for a film that featured this country (Aurora Dominicana on Vimeo was an amazing resource). A Haitian academic living across the border finds himself out of work and deeply depressed. Struggling with his religion, he pleads God to fix him, to let him have something of his own. It is deeply melancholic and drags you through his self imposed hopelessness despite receiving help and compassion from others. Loved that this film showed so much of the DR and even had a dramatic fly over shot of Haiti. 8/10

East Timor - The Barefoot Dream: I'll be honest I settled pretty quickly for this one. I stumbled on a movie set here and didn't go much further. A Korean movie set in East Timor, our neighbour to the North, about a constantly failing Korean entrepreneur who settles in this impoverished country with the aim to sell sports equipment. A ""true story"" that is basically just a classic sports movie with the same arc as any other but with the added benefit of ticking a country off my list. Sorry Timor Leste. 4/10

Ecuador - 24 Hours of Pleasure: A comedy of errors with the horniness turned up to 10. However this is not sexy and not really funny either. Shot in Quinto in the 60s it's interesting how ""American"" Latin America was back then. The whole film had a what if a poor country was doing it's best impression of the United States. If I can find another film this might be an interesting country to see how much has changed. Or perhaps I'll visit. Anyway movie is like a 4/10. 

Egypt - Cairo Station: An Arabic thriller/film noir about a crippled mentally unwell man that slowly builds a hatred for his fellow train station workers due to his unrequited love for a local woman and the general dismissal by his peers. Editing in swings from amateurish all the way back to masterful. This could possibly be due to technical limitations of the 50s but is sometimes jarring. The director also stars as the main character and puts in a great performance, really making you feel for, but simultaneously repulsed by,this 1950s poverty stricken incel. 7/10

Short list as I'm currently in the process of buying my first home. Turns out there is a bit too it. I'm also quickly running out of year. Coming up on the halfway point and not keeping pace with the films. I'm still have fun however and hope to hear from anyone that's read this far.

Gone Girl (2014): Did Amy love Nick?,"I'm not going to lie, I've read the book and seen the movie many times (there are differences between it) but I never knew if Amy really loved Nick or not?

First, Amy is a sociopath, I am not a psychiatrist, but what I do know is that sociopaths are incapable of love, they enter into relationships if there is benefits behind it (correct me if I wrong), but in the movie Amy did some things that baffled me, such as:

- Pretend to be a ""cool girl"" in order to impress Nick.

- Buy him a bar.

- Moving in with him to be with his dying mother, giving up everything.

- Most importantly, her face as she listens to Nick's interview on TV, killing Desi to go back to Nick, and telling him ""I killed for you.""

So, why did she does all this? Why did she come back to him in the first place? Is it because she really loves him or for some other reason?",movies,82,1685342578.0,0.78
What are your go to movies with family?,"Hello fellow Redditors, I hope your weekend went well. Here in the USA of Northern America, this weekend we celebrated Memorial Day which in turn means a 3 day extended weekend for the most of us.  And with school out, my family (my 2 parents, my teen son, and I) partake in a long standing tradition of the Eastern coast living folks of renting a beach house in the Outer Banks of the state of North Carolina for the week.  The weather has been somewhat crap, rain and thunderstorms since we arrived on Saturday. Which means lots of junk food snacks, microwaved food, and television in the living room.  So far we've consumed a season or 2 of Yellowstone, a few episodes of Doc Martin, some sort of golf competition, and many shows and movies I can't really remember. But, we always watch the same dozen movies and type of TV shows.  
So far this weekend I think we've watched for the 100th time,
Signs
Constantine
Dune, the new one
A Batman flick, this time the new one with R Pat
A Tarantino flick, Reservoir Dogs and both Kill Bills
A military flick for Dad, Echo 3 on Apple+
Both Riddick movies in sequence 
Mindhunter, it's the one that if we can't agree on something, we watch it
And to lighten it all up, usually the first season of Derry Girls or Ted Lasso with breakfast.  
Also my parents love Doom Patrol, so that's on repeat in between it all.

So my question to you is, what are your comfort watches with the family while on holiday?  

Are we alone in going on holiday and sitting in front of the tube instead of going out and doing something?  

Do you also rewatch the same classics that you've seen dozens of times?",movies,3,1685413214.0,0.59
Help: Movie about the crew on a spaceship that attacks each other and end up driving it into a star,"Hoping someone can help me track down a movie that I remember seeing on cable in the early to mid 2,000s a couple of times. I'm guessing released late 90's - early 00s.

It was set in space on a massive ship (a cargo ship I think) and I can most vividly remember the end: The two survivors drive the ship into the sun, flashing lights in a sequence to indicate biohazard warning (three yellow, one red if i remember correctly, which is weird).

I cant remember much of what happens, but I think the crew go a bit crazy and end up killing most of each other, and it turns out at the end that its some virus or something that makes them go nuts and turns their blood blue. There MIGHT have been some frozen people who they ejected before turning for the sun, but I cant really remember.

I've been googling with no luck and it's driving me nuts - hopefully someone knows!

Maybe it’s me, but I don’t see much of a story within the movie. It felt more about a technical showcase of how good the practical effects were. Sure, it had its creepiness, but the characters and story were so underdeveloped, I felt really unsatisfied in the end.

Two things stood out, among a lot of other parts of the movie:

There’s a scene where David was in panic mode, trying to get himself arrested by cursing disparaging the royalty, just so he can be kept away from the public. He could’ve punched the cop or a bystander, or done a little bit more for an actual arrest to happen, but then simply gives up and runs off.

At the end, David as the werewolf is cornered, Alex tries to talk to him, then he’s simply shot down by police, his dead body turns back to human form, roll credits. No amazement, no discovery, just the end. Did I miss something?",movies,6,1685376327.0,0.56
Scream VI's ending made me more worried about the financial crisis survivors will face,"Yes, I'm late to the party. I enjoyed the film and had a good time.

But I couldn't enjoyed the ending as it is. To be honest, the ending left me more worried about the chracters' future, not happy for them survived. Seriously think about all the hospital bills they will recieve in the future. This is not their first time calling ambulances for stabs, it's their SECOND FUCKING TIME. Their parents must have a really good health insurance for paying their children's hospital bill (and sending them to an university in NYC as well. Mindy and Chad's parents somehow managed to afford tuition for TWO children.) It gives me a headache just to think about the cost of surgery and rehabilitation they will have to undergo.

Maybe I'm just too old and realistic to enjoy the film itself, but the financial crisis that survivors will face was scarier than the movie itself. The next sequel should be called *Scream VII: aftermass of hospital fee*, and it should be about survivors trying to survive from bankruptcy. In this economy, it will be more horrifying than a random weirdo chasing the survivors to kill.",movies,0,1685424615.0,0.44

ps could this be a simpsons episode bc now i’m kinda thinking it might be but i’m sure they were real people lol

edit: sorry if this is a spoiler for anyone if we figure out the movie but i’m not sure if it is.

edit for more details i’m slowly remembering: there’s a german chef? like he’s specifically german and they like talk about it. also to add on to earlier there’s like a big banquet/party thing going on in a different room and then they go to the kitchen because they think the german chef is the killer?? guys idk 😭😭",movies,0,1685432455.0,0.42

Ford v Ferrari (2019) Is the Best Car Movie I've Ever Seen,"I don't know why I've slept on this movie for so long, given that I'm a fan of both Christian Bale and Matt Damon, but holy crap is this movie good! 

First off, I feel like it could be enjoyed by both people who are into cars, and people who just want to see a good movie with tension, drama, solid acting and heartfelt moments. 

The movie is less about Ford as an organization versus Ferrari, but more about the journey of Bale and Damon's characters as they try to build the best car they can, despite all the setbacks. It really shows their passion for what they do and the bond that these people had. 

The racing sequences are incredible, and never have I felt so much tension while looking at a rev meter on a car!

Birth of a nation(2014) was remade in the perspective of the black Americans who revolted for their freedom : what movies do you want it to be remade from antagonists point of view ?,"The film was controversial even before its release, and it has remained so ever since; it has been called ""the most controversial film ever made in the United States""[12]: 198  and ""the most reprehensibly racist film in Hollywood history"".[13] Lincoln is nevertheless portrayed positively, albeit a friend of the South, atypical of a narrative that promotes the Lost Cause ideology. The film has been denounced for its racist depiction of African Americans.[8] The film portrays its black characters (many of whom are played by white actors in blackface) as unintelligent and sexually aggressive toward white women. The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is portrayed as a heroic force, necessary to preserve American values, protect white women, and maintain white supremacy.[14][15]

Popular among white audiences nationwide, the film's success was both a consequence of and a contributor to racial segregation throughout the U.S.[16] In response to the film's depictions of black people and Civil War history, African Americans across the U.S. organized and protested. In Boston and other localities, black leaders and the NAACP spearheaded an unsuccessful campaign to have it banned on the basis that it inflamed racial tensions and could incite violence.[17] Griffith's indignation at efforts to censor or ban the film motivated him to produce Intolerance the following year.[18]

In spite of its divisiveness, The Birth of a Nation was a huge commercial success across the nation—grossing more than any previous motion picture—and it profoundly influenced both the film industry and American culture. The film has been acknowledged as an inspiration for the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan, which took place only a few months after its release. In 1992, the Library of Congress deemed the film ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.[19][20]",movies,0,1685433147.0,0.36

Richard III vs Richard III?,"I’m exploring my Shakespeare on film and tripped over Ian McKellen is Richard the third from 1995. Loved it! I’ve never read the play before and I understand that some changes were made to the script, but Ian was spectacular in the film and it kept my interest due to the setting in the story and the acting.

Also, on HBO was a 1955 version of Lawrence Olivier playing Richard the third. I’m sure it is as of its time… That being said, it seemed a lot less accessible to me. You can tell it was a (relatively) low budget affair on static stages, and The most important part of the movie for Olivier was the script, not the setting.

Of course they are their own time, and it may be unfair to compare the two, but I found the Ian McKellen version superior (even though I read later that Richard the third was in his early 30s when he died, so that kind of aged Ian McKellen out of the role).",movies,13,1685348187.0,0.66

Its themes of unionization and how capitalists try their best to thwart the efforts of their employees to band together is an eye opener.

The movie gives us a harsh look into the life of employees who are trying their best to go through their everyday life, it is scary how little has changed over the course of eighty years.

I found this film to be quiet ahead of its time. It was even feministic for its time period, showing women take agency in relationships and all.

When Bettina calling her husband in Russia and he is having an affair then (mirroring) Chuck calls from Russia and Kelly does not answer multiple calls (this is because she is with Jerry when Chuck is out of town. The two scenes are reflections of each other.

John Wick is so clearly a satire.,"Seriously how isn't anyone talking about this. I just finished John Wick chapter 2 was cracking up the whole time.   
For example, The whole fight scene between John Wick and Cassian is so clear dead giveaway. Leading to the subway station, where John Wick and Cassian suspiciously shoot each other in middle of a hundred people and nobody bats an eye, then inside the subway where John Wick and Cassian stand awkwardly amidst the commuters, staring at each other contemplating resuming the fight, but resisting for a while, and John Wick delivering that badass line and immediately everyone scurrying away as the door opens. The whole scene from start to end is just filled with comedic GOLD. Even the name of the antagonist is hilarious, like for real? SANTONIO D'ANTONIO?  


The whole series incorporates satirical elements within the action genre. John Wick's exaggerated violence and its stylized presentation of the titular character as an unstoppable force satirize the hyper-masculine and superhero-like personas often portrayed in action films. The film's portrayal of an underground society of assassins with their own set of rules and rituals serves as a parody of the genre's tendency to create elaborate, almost fantastical worlds. By exaggerating and poking fun at these conventions, John Wick ultimately becomes a self-aware commentary on the very genre it appears to embody.   


I think the director of the franchise is making a joke out of those who watch the series unironically, and honestly that makes it even more funnier.",movies,0,1685446299.0,0.18

Actors who have played multiple historical figures from the same time period,"Congratulations to Koji Yakusho for winning the best actor award at Cannes for the film Perfect Days. He's been in so many fantastic Japanese films over the past few decades. My personal favorite is from Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Cure. But he has also made a career of portraying famous samurai.

His breakout role was playing **Oda Nobunaga** in a major TV drama in 1983. TLDR: he tried to unite Japan and is perhaps the most famous person in Japanese history (see Takeshi Kitano's upcoming movie Kubi as well as the recently released epic The Legend and Butterfly). He had already played Nobunaga's less important son **Nobutaka Oda** a few years prior. In 2013, he starred as Nobunaga's top general **Shibata Katsuie** in The Kiyosu Conference, a historical comedy which still features both Odas.

In 2017, he would appear in Sekigahara as commander **Tokugawa Ieyasu**. TLDR: Sekigahara was the deciding battle of this era of Japan, and Tokugawa and his family would officially unite the country and rule over it for 200+ years. Pretty good film. 

Going back a few years both historically and contemporarly, Yakusho would also play **Takeda Shingen** in an eponymous movie from 1991. TLDR: He was the strongest regional warlord (and the subject of Akira Kurosawa's Kagemusha) and was killed by the combined forces of Nobunaga and Ieyasu. Yakusho and Yakusho (along with his son Yakusho and his general Yakusho) killed Yakusho.

He also plays **Miyamoto Mushashi** in a famous TV show. TLDR: He's a decent swordsman who is referenced pretty much anytime samurai swords are mentioned. Watch that trilogy of Toshiro Mifune films. He was born right after Nobunaga died and only possibly went to Sekigahara, but he's still around the same time period.

I know it has a decent cult following but was worried it would be one of those movies you have to be a kid to really like. Luckily, this wasn't the case at all and I really enjoyed the hell out of this early 90s superhero film. Love how it is basically a superhero film but with a dash of Indiana Jones. Bill Campbell is perfect in the lead. Honestly this guy I think could have made a great Clark Kent/Superman if there had been a Superman film in the 90s. Timothy Dalton is just awesome as the villain playing both the charming actor part and evil Nazi part great and Jennifer Connelly, Damn! What more can be said about her. Loved the late great Paul Sorvino as the supporting bad guy. The moment where he turns against Sinclair is a great moment. Also this might be one of James Horner's best score. What happened to majestic scores like this? Movies will never be the same after Horner died. 

If I do have an issue, I just wish the movie was a bit longer and we saw a little more of Cliff using the rocket a bit more before the climax. Maybe a scene of him stopping some robbers or something

It's a shame that this movie didn't do very well at the box office when it came out. It would have been great if this had been a franchise.

From what I've heard for all this years, I was expecting something absolutely spectacular, but my god it is so far from that. 
I've seen far too many people considering LOTR, Harry Potter and Star Wars as the three pillars of fantasy/fiction in movies, but not only do I consider the first two much more superior, I straight up think the Star Wars (original trilogy) are just bad movies period. 
From a technical point of view, they're actually good, and I believe they aged fine, but the plot, the characters, the story, the world building are extremely poor. 
The worst thing by far are the plot holes: they are crucial and plentiful. 


Am I the only one that thinks this? 
I'd like to be proven wrong, perhaps with examples from the actual movies, because I've got a list of what I believe to be are plot holes that might be explained (within the movies of course, not fandoms).

Cool Hand Luke (1967),"Watched this movie for the first time today after finding it on the iTunes Store for $4.99. I’ve long been a fan of Paul Newman and, as this is one of the rare 100% movies on RT and contains #11 on the AFI’s 100 Years, 100 Movie Quotes List (What we’re dealing with here is failure to communicate.), I felt compelled to finally give it a watch.

To say it was more than worth the five dollars is an understatement. Newman played the title role brilliantly and there were solid supporting roles from George Kennedy as fellow inmate Dragline and Strother Martin as the villain, the Captain.

Its role as one of the earliest anti-establishment films of the Vietnam War era and its subtle use of Christian imagery are quite remarkable and the film certainly holds up after almost six decades. It is especially enjoyable if you’re a fan of other prison dramas such as The Shawshank Redemption as there’s a rather similar tone between the two films.

This one, in my opinion, has certainly earned its 100% RT rating and is well worth the watch. I was quite glad to find it at such a great price and highly recommend this for addition to your film collection if you haven’t already seen it.",movies,239,1685255352.0,0.89

ip man 4 review in one shot," 

https://preview.redd.it/bjkltwvttp2b1.png?width=220&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a168d48606aad87570403a5951ccadf9d48dfa40

Ip Man 4: The Finale is a fitting end to the popular martial arts film series starring Donnie Yen as the legendary Wing Chun master. While the plot may not be as cohesive or compelling as the earlier installments, the movie still delivers plenty of thrilling fight scenes and emotional moments that will satisfy fans of the genre and the franchise.

The biggest theme of Ip Man 4 is the struggle of Chinese immigrants and their descendants to adapt and find acceptance in America during the 1960s, especially in the face of racism and stereotyping. This idea is reflected in various subplots, from Ip Man's relationship with his son who studies in a U.S. school, to the conflicts between the Chinese martial artists and the Western boxing enthusiasts, to the antagonism between Ip Man and a pompous American army officer who undermines Chinese culture.

These topics add depth and resonance to the movie, but they don't always get enough time to develop or converge smoothly, leaving some of the supporting characters or themes underdeveloped. Nonetheless, the action scenes are where Ip Man 4 truly shines, showcasing the Wing Chun style's speed, precision, and adaptability against various other fighting methods. The choreography, cinematography, and sound effects are all top-notch, making every punch, kick, and weapon strike look and sound impactful.

Donnie Yen once again commands the spotlight with his charismatic and dignified portrayal of Ip Man, who remains a role model of honor, compassion, and wisdom despite facing personal and social challenges. The other cast members, including Vanness Wu, Scott Adkins, Chris Collins, and Danny Chan, also deliver solid performances, even if they don't get enough character arcs or motivations.

Overall, Ip Man 4: The Finale may not be as seminal or inventive as the first Ip Man, but it's still a well-crafted and satisfying conclusion to the series, offering a mix of martial arts spectacle, historical insight, and inspirational value. If you're a fan of Asian action movies or Ip Man himself, this movie is worth watching.",movies,5,1685324126.0,0.63

Obscure WWII or Korean War Combat Films (English),"Taking care of my elderly father (3+ years). He pretty much only wants to watch WWII and Korean War combat movies. We've gone through hundreds of American, British movies (and a few Australian and Canadian ones), but I'm running out of 'em. 

Any leads on obscure combat movies for WWII and the Korean War? I went through the WWII and Korean War movie Wikipedia pages and found nearly all of them (but it was missing some). Quality isn't super-crucial (b-movies work) as he isn't particularly picky. He's not into dramas or spy/espionage so much. It's getting rough to feed the beast!

Thoughts on Coming to America (1988)?,"Coming to America turns 35 this year. This is considered one of the best Eddie Murphy films. I think it has aged well with time which is surprising because rom-coms have a mixed track record.

The film has a slow, sweet pace where character interactions lead the story. It has the usual romantic comedy cliches till the last moment. But the execution was good. I think the casting was brilliant and the film does have abundant comedic scenes. Loved the dudes at the barbershop having a good time.

The casting was really well done with John Amos as Cleo McDowell & James Earl Jones as the King being standouts.

It was interesting to see the lack of music in many places. Sometimes the movie felt awkward due to the lack of score and slightly weak editing. But overall the direction gets it home.

My rating: 7/10.

So Glass Onion and Knives Out are direct lifts of 'And Then There Were None' and 'Crooked House' by Agatha Christie?,"I just finished 'and then there were none' and have recently started 'crooked house'....

""Having grown up devouring Christie novels, Johnson’s chief objective with both “Knives Out” and “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” was reproducing the joy he felt watching older adaptations of her mysteries with his whole family...""

What movie is better when you watch as an adult than when you watch it as a kid?,"Just the title.


Question came to me by watching Lilo and Stitch again as an adult. As a kid it was a funny movie about a girl and her pet alien doing wacky hijinks in the face of her annoying older sister and funny aliens, and I remember it was okay.

Watching it again I realised it's a surprisingly heavy movie about a struggling older sister in poverty trying to keep her sister while not having the means to support her.

Also, I realised that the movie has no real villain and all the characters I percieved as ""evil"" as a child were just well meaning adults in a complex situation.


* Nani - was trying to parent a difficult child as a teenager after losing her parents
* The scary social services agent - was just looking to do what's best for Lilo. As a kid I though he was just cruel.
* The scary alien councilwoman - was just trying to capture what she thought was a dangerous terrorist

Closest thing to a villain this movie has are Jumba the scientist and Stitch himself.

Why don’t Pixar movies get criticism for being formulaic or repetitive?,"At one time, Pixar was leading the way in terms of animation and story. Their movies were able to tap into complex emotions and sincerity while still being funny for all ages. 

But their output of late seems derivative. They have a movie called Elemental coming out and I swear it looks like the exact same story as their last few movies. 

Two opposites have go on a journey together and at first don’t get along but then realize they aren’t so different after all and end up caring for each other. I’m guessing there will probably be a misunderstanding at some point that makes them fight after thinking they were friends. 

This type of story isn’t unique to Pixar but it seems they overly rely on this formula a lot. Soul, Onward, Luca all followed this formula.

What are your examples of a 100% perfect film? Nothing can be cut,"Like it says, the film is perfect start to finish, every scene is essential, there is *no fat.* 



My pick is Spoorloos (1988) AKA The Vanishing



***!!!SPOILERS AHEAD FOR SPOORLOOS!!!***


From the moment the film starts with credits, there are shots of Rex and Saskia playing a game where they name things that start with a certain letter. Rex is teaching her to speak French. Both her lessons with Rex, and the specific game they use come into play when Saskia meets Raymond.

Seemingly silly things like the lighter Saskia buys Rex is the one he uses to light up his coffin(and it doesn’t last long because he’s used it for 3 years), and the price for the frisbee she buys is the same as the gift she wants to buy for Rex from Raymond. Raymond refers to many of these series of events as fate in the final act.

Anytime where someone is traveling from point A to B contains storytelling; Raymond walking to a work function sees a poster of a missing Saskia, and a conversation unfolds about why Raymond cares so much, and their conversation continues on how the coworker thinks kidnappers should be crucified, and Raymond asks what if it was him.

The longest traveling scene is when Raymond and Rex are together, and every bit of information you get from that point up until Rex is drugged is relevant. Even the conversation where the two are laughing about odd names, and Raymond mentions his neighbor’s dog name is Rex. Rex laughs about this in the grave as he shouts his name in defiance of the situation.

Rex running off when getting outside for a minute with his girlfriend ended up with him having the same floating egg dream that Saskia did.

Raymond’s brief scene in his classroom shows he’s an expert in Chemistry, therefore knows well how to use chemicals on his victims and how to mix them.


There are even more character details throughout this film, but at a tight 90 min, this film is meticulously decorated with detail, storytelling, and character development.

What movie am I thinking of?," 

# I remember seeing a movie where a girl is sent to live with an eccentric scientist in the hope that she will also become a scientist, but the scientist actually has an evil plan to blow her up in an explosion. The girl routinely communicates with her father while living with the scientist through a high-tech version of a video call, but in actuality, she was just communicating with the scientist wearing an extremely realistic mask. There was one scene where the evil scientist and one of his helpers were talking about their plan, and how the girl was about to explode, and someone heard them so they quickly pivoted and started talking about her turning into a great scientist. In the end, the girl eventually finds out about the plan, and the evil scientist actually gets killed in the explosion, not the girl. An avalanche may have been involved, disrupting the evil scientist's plan. I think it takes place in a snowy mountain, and snowboarding has something to do with the movie. It was most likely a PG movie. It was in English, and it came out before 2019. I watched it between 2015-2019. It was live-action.

I'm looking for information on a film by Haneke but I just can't find it, so I'm asking for help from those of you who may know something about it: the film is Caché (Hidden, 2005), and the information is this: without revealing nothing too much (for he hadn't seen it) in the film at one point an animal is killed, but I would like to know if it was really killed or is it a special effect of some kind.

The reason is that I love the film and would like to show it to my daughter and wife, but both are very sensitive to animal abuse.

Actually I am too: I can't stand the representation of any kind of violence against animals anymore: even the famous sequence of the ox and the tribe in the jungle in Apocalypse Now today I struggle to see it again (despite having seen the film dozens of times over the course of my life: evidently as I got older I became like this).

So: if anyone knows how that scene in Haneke's Caché (Hidden) was shot, and whether or not that animal was actually killed, please let me know.

Recommendations for Legally Blind Person,"Hi! I didn’t watch movies much growing up, and I’m legally blind. My condition is regretory, as in it was worst when I was born, and improved until I hit puberty (ocular albinism, specifically). I still have a lot of trouble distinguishing people in movies unless they wear very distinct clothes etc.

As such, most of what I’ve watched as an adult has been sci fi, fantasy, or animated. Dramas and romance movies are typically too hard for me to watch without someone telling me who’s speaking because I can’t tell them apart. I am fluent in English and Japanese, but no recommendations outside those languages unless there’s a dub because, well, blind. I had to take a classics movie class in college and while I liked the singing in the ones that had them, the lack of color made it even harder to see what was on screen.

Are there any movies you think would be worth a watch for me- classic or recent? I’m fine with some deep cuts but it’s got to be visually high contrast or distinct enough and I’d like to step out of my comfort zone.

Clues were scare and yes, it felt as though he was as chasing a phantom, but my god. Almost never seen a film piss its pants so badly.

What was the movie that invented or popularized the use of licensed soundtrack albums with original songs by popular artists?,"I remember back in 2018 both the first Black Panther and Spider-Verse movies kinda started this trend, with albums containing original music both featuring in and inspired by their respective movies. Fast forward to nowadays, and every now and then some popular movie with blockbuster ambitions will release an accompanying official licensed original album featuring many artists with original songs, the latest case being the Barbie movie. Even the final season of Game of Thrones did it.


Was Black Panther the very first case/inventor of this type of project, or were there other movies that did this before? I thought of 2016 Suicide Squad, but I've checked, and it's just a compilation of songs that existed beforehand and weren't made for the movie.

The Big Bus (1976) review," Before there was Airplane! there was The Big Bus, a good and charming parody of heavy handed disaster dramas. 

Coyote Bus Lines is  set to reveal their newest innovation in Bus travel with the unveiling  of Cyclops, a two story nuclear powered superbus complete with all the  luxuries of a cruise ship and promising a non-stop trip from New York  City to Denver. When an act of industrial espionage takes out the driver  and cp-driver of the inaugural journey, the injured/parking lot  confined Professor Baxter (Harold Gould) enlists his daughter Kitty  (Stockard Channing) to recruit Kitty's former fiancé and once great bus  driver, Dan Torrance (Joseph Bologna), much to Kitty's reluctance. Dan  has had a tough go in recent years due to an incident on Mount Diablo  where 110 passengers were lost to Cannibalism of Dan's co-pilot, but  because he accidentally ate stew made from a foot he carries the stigma.  Dan Agrees to pilot the big bus unaware that saboteurs have insidious  plans to keep it from reaching Denver.  


Released in 1976, The Big  Bus was released at the height of the 70s wave of Disaster films with  Universal's Airport series only on its first sequel and the Charlton  Heston fronted ensemble Earthquake only two years prior. Directed by  noted TV director James Frawley of The Monkees (who would go on to  direct The Muppet Movie) and written and produced by noted TV writers  Lawrence J. Cohen and Fred Freeman of Gilligan's Island, Andy Griffith,  and Bewitched, the movie went mostly ignored at the box office during  its initial run and eventually became overshadowed by the much more  successful Airplane! Four years later. The Big Bus aired infrequently on  TV after its release, not exactly getting a second life but did attract  a minor cult following from those who remember it, and rightly so  because while not as tight or sharp as Airplane it's a very funny farce  that plays up its silliness and camp in fun and inventive ways.  


Watching  The Big Bus it does almost feel like a first draft of Airplane! With  Ted Striker's character in airplane nearly identical to Dan Torrance  with them both being ""great pilots with tragic backstories"" and even  individual gags such as panicking the passengers over the intercom are  done in a near identical fashion here to how'd they be done in Airplane  four years later. This can probably be written off as mere coincidence  since most of these as delivered are funhouse mirror exaggerations of  the tricks and tropes seen in films of the Irwin Allen variety or the  Airport films, but it still is pretty glaring in terms of the  similarity. While The Big Bus doesn't have the extra level of polish  Airplane! Had, I think the movie still makes itself a worthwhile viewing  even outside of its historical curiosity preceding Airplane!.  


Much  like the disaster epics it spoofs, The Big Bus features a veritable  ""who's who?"" of talent with the likes of Joseph Bologna, Stockard  Channing, René Auberjonois, Sally Kellerman, Richard Mulligan, Ned  Beatty, and too many other to mention who all play the collection of  broad eccentrics with gusto fitting well in line with the cartoonish and  anarchic tone set by the film. From Sally Kellerman and Richard  Mulligan's on/off soon to be divorced couple who go from hurling insults  at each other to going just shy of full intercourse on the bus floor,  to Murphy Dunne as lounge piano player Tommy Joyce playing inappropriate  commentary/music at the worst possible times, the movie knows it has a  killer cast and does everything it can to put them in bits of sheer  ridiculousness that'll crack a smile on even the most harsh of viewers.  Everyone brings their ""A"" game treating the ridiculousness and madness  with complete seriousness as if they're actually in an Irwin Allen film.  The one downside would probably be in the film's antagonist, known only  as ""Ironman""(José Ferrer), who's just kind of there. His gimmick is  spending all of his time in an Iron Lung and his exchanges with his  henchman sabotaging the titular bus are unfortunately some of the major  dead spots in the movie that curtail the film's momentum.  


The Big  Bus may not be as well known as Airplane!, but it is an enjoyable  disaster farce that humorously treats its ridiculous nuclear powered bus  with the same reverence and melodrama seen in the Airport films and  turning the tropes on their heads into comic silver (not quite gold, but  on the cusp). It's a shame the movie isn't more widely known because it  runs at a quick clip keeping the sight gags, exchanges, and chaos  coming to mostly successful effect save for the occasional dead spot. If  you enjoyed Airpalne!, you owe it to yourself to see the film that  cleared the way for it.",movies,36,1685213759.0,0.74

Finally was able to see ‘Dragon Princess’ by Jean-Jacques Denis and Anthony Roux,"For context, I’ve been following the development of this movie for about a decade ever since I saw some watercolour concept art back in high school. 

Eight to ten years later, two degrees, and getting married I find it finally was made, was show at the Annecy film festival, but that there were no plans for an international release yet. Finally, about a month ago, I check out what would be showing at my city’s international children’s animation festival this year. I immediately bought tickets for my wife and I.

There are scenes where characters heads are cut off at the top of the frame. 

Scenes where characters walk off-frame and the camera doesn't follow, but they continue speaking.

Scenes where two characters will have a back and forth discussion, but the camera only focuses on the back of one actor's head instead of showing them speaking. 

Scenes were characters speak off-screen, but then aren't shown. 

A scene where one character is speaking but she's mostly obscured by a beach umbrella

And a scene where Rufus Sewell and Ken Leung's characters are arguing, but Rufus is so far to the right of screen only his nose and chin are visible in frame.

The Incredibles is an allegory for Nice Guy Syndrome.,"I recently realized something about the Incredibles. I interpret it as an allegory for Nice Guy Syndrome. To be clear, I do not think that the writers intended it this way, that is simply how I chose to interpret it. 

Nice guy syndrome is when you feel entitled to romantic affection for simply behaving like a decent person. The flaw in this line of reasoning is two fold. First of all, being kind, treating your fellow human beings with respect and giving them what is rightfully theirs is an expected trait of every human being. If being nice were all that it took to not only get into a relationship, but also make the relationship work, that guy or lady in whom you are interested would already be in a relationship. Second, and more to the point, no one is entitled to a romantic relationship. It is called nice guy syndrome, because most of the people who suffer from it are heterosexual men, but women and gay men can experience it too. 

Nice guys syndrome is scary, as it can lead to such violent attrocities as the mass shooting committed by Elliot Rodger in May of 2014. Elliot Rodger was a now dead YouTuber and famous Incel when he was alive. Incel is short for involuntary celibate and it refers to man who is not sexually active or is not in a relationship, but desperately wants to be. In May of 2014, Elliot stabbed three men in his apartment, went to a sorority at the University of California, Santa Barbara to shot three female students (killing two), drove to a nearby deli to shot and kill a male student inside, speed through Isla Vista to run over several people with his car, had a shoot out with the police where in he recieved a nonfatal shot to the hip and eventually crashed into a parked car. Eventually, he was found by police dead from suicide carried out with his hand gun. Before committing this mass murder, Elliot uploaded a YouTube video titled Elliot Rodger's Retribution, where in he outlined his plan to kill several people, including himself. Here is a link to the Wikipedia page about Elliot:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014\_Isla\_Vista\_killings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Isla_Vista_killings)

Yeah, nice guy syndrome causes stuff like that. 

If you really think about it, Syndrome is like Elliot Rodger. Rodger held resentment toward women who would not date him and at men who got dates instead of him. Rodger felt entitled to a relationship. Young Buddy Pine felt entitled to be Mr. Incredible’s side kick. Just like no one is entitled to a relationship, Buddy was not entitled to be Mr. Incredible’s side kick. If Rodger where interested in a woman and said hypothetical woman decided to exercise her right to spurn his advances, he should have just moved on to a different woman. Similarly, if Buddy wanted to be someone’s side kick and Mr. Incredible decided to exercise his right to work alone if he so pleases, Buddy could have asked a different super for permission to be a side kick. Buddy proved himself to have genius level intellect, inventing weapons more powerful than just about any super power. Buddy could have become a super hero himself. 

When Syndrome monologues about his motivations, Mr. Incredible apologises for the way he treated young Buddy Pine. It is unclear if Mr. Incredible really meant what he said or if he was kissing Syndrome’s butt, because Syndrome was a threat. I really hope it is the latter. The truth is, Mr. Incredible did not mistreat young Buddy pine at all. Mr. Incredible was nice, he stood for photos and signed every scrap of paper Buddy pushed at him. Buddy had a bloated sense of entitlement and crossed a line when he demanded Mr. Incredible accept him (Buddy) as his side kick, entered Mr. Incredible’s car without his permission and refused to take no for an answer. If Mr. Incredible did not want a sidekick, it was Mr. Incredible’s right to work alone. Mr. Incredible is allowed to reject Buddy’s request to be his side kick for any reason, no reason at all or even a made up reason. When Buddy went to go get the police, he had a bomb on him. Mr. Incredible grabbed Buddy and removed the bomb. Buddy yelled at Mr. Incredible for wrecking his flight patterns. For over a decade after the fact, Buddy held resentment toward Mr. Incredible and never realized that Mr. Incredible saved his life. If Mr. Incredible had just let Buddy get blown up, Bomb Voyage wouldn’t have gotten away, the L-train accident wouldn’t have occurred, and neither would the genocide of the super heroes.",movies,0,1685329265.0,0.23
Terminator Salvation appreciation post,"I would like to start by saying that I don't want to compare this movie to any other in the universe. It is not the best nor the worst, but I liked it. Here is why.

The positives:
It is hard to imagine different John Connor but TEH John Connor, but if we need to replace Edward Furlong, our guy Bale works perfectly. 

Judgement day finally happened and the world is all messed up, and it is done perfectly IMHO. Even though a lot of scenes are shot outside and in daylight, there is a constant feeling of unease and fear. Terminators swim, fly, drive, etc. Everything is dusty, cities are in ruins and dangerous place to be, etc.

An amazing scene that is done in literally one shot (CGI ofc and stuff), which many didn't even notice on the start of the movie, John Connor climbs up from the hole and runs for a chopper, camera follows and doesn't stop until way later when he gets attacked. Just an brilliant sequence!

New Terminators are introduced, which totally would make sense, why keep human form only if there are more efficient ways to hunt. 

Nostalgic moments from the T2 with music, certain scenes in the Cyberdyne, etc.

Decent to great acting all around. 

I could go on and on.

The most important thing is the strong ending with the amazing message, almost as strong as the T2 one. I mean ""It's not something you can program. You can't put it into a chip. It's the strength of the human heart. The difference between us and machines."" - AS HE IS DYING FOR HIM... Holy Sh** that was powerful and still is. 

Negatives:

Some plot holes

How easy they kill the Terminators

The ease of entering the main Terminator base (unless they let him do it on purpose)

Finally watched Sicario,"I know this is a pretty universally liked movie around here, but one of the biggest things that caught my attention was just how much the CIA dominated every part of the movie. The movie does a phenomenal job at dragging you along the way that Blunt is, you think you know what its going to be like, ""Oh Emily Blunt is going to roll up with the CIA and kick narco ass"" then it changes  


The CIA and CAG guys roll the gangsters without breaking a sweat, the whole movie you just... feel that Brolin's character lives the phrase 

""You exist because we allow it, and you will end because we demand it."" (Mass Effect) 

But it does a fantastic job of capturing the futility of the cartel war. 

For all that they've done in the movie, it's just sowing chaos and trying to pick the winner. As much as the CIA dominated the tactical situation, the strategic victory, ""Until we convince 20% of the population to stop snorting and shooting up, this is the best we can do"" is lost to them",movies,881,1685129520.0,0.87

"A question for the movie ""Climax""(2018) of Gaspar Noe (HUGE SPOILER)","I have searched on the internet and I haven't managed to find an answer.

So in Climax, when everyone attacked Lou and started insulting her and trying to make her kill herself, I just wonder... why she did what she did to herself. I mean instead of trying to defend herself and the baby, she started, out of nowhere, punching her belly causing her baby to instantly die. That was super fucked up but, at the same time, completely weird. I just don't get it. After that, the fact that she used the knife to cut her arms and face, probably means that she either wanted them all to leave her alone, or that she had a mental breakdown that resulted in self-harming. The latter could also explain the punches in the belly, but I still think it's totally random and is there just to shock.

Freddie as F. R. O.7 (aka Freddie the Frog) (1992) review," A messy and confusing family fantasy James Bond spoof that has clear effort, but lack of structure or direction.  

In Medieval France,  a young prince named Frederic (Edmund Kingsley) is taught by his father  the Magician King (Michal Hordern) various spells and lives a happy  life with him. Unbeknownst to Frederic and the King, the King's jealous  sister, Messina (Billie Whitelaw), is planning to kill the king and  usurp the power of the throne having already arranged for the death of  Frederic's mother some year's back using her black magic. Messina  disguises herself as a serpent and scares the King's horse and the King  dies as a result of her actions. Messina is left as the kingdom's ruler  with Frederic as his ward til he comes of age, but Messina uses her  magic to transform Frederic into a frog and reveals her true intentions.  Frederic is saved by a chance encounter with the Loch Ness monster,  Nessie (Phyllis Logan), and Messina is forced to retreat. Sometime later  Frederic has grown (now voiced by Ben Kingsley) and is now the French  Secret Serivde's top secret agent Freddie aka F. R. O.7. Britain is  beset by a series of disappearances of its most famous monuments and  with the British Secret Service lacking in manpower, its head Brigadier G  (Nigel Hawthorne) requests the French government loan Freddie to them.  Freddie is teamed with two other agents, martial artist Daffers (Jenny  Agutter) who also has a crush on Freddie, and weapons inventor Scotty  (John Sessions). As the group investigate the disappearance of the  monuments they come to discover the culprits are a criminal organization  known as The Snake which is lead by Freddie's aunt Messina and her  husband El Supremo (Brian Blessed) who are bent on taking over Britain  using the latent energy hidden within its monuments with grander sights  on world domination.  


Freddie as F. R. O.7 (aka Freddie the Frog)  was one of many animated films released throughout the 90s that tried to  capitalize on the revised interest in theatrical animation that began  in the 80s with Don Bluth's films An American Tail and Land Before Time  and exploded with the likes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit and The Little  Mermaid. While many animated Disney films were massively successful such  as Aladdin which became the highest grossing film of 1992, non-Disney  productions tended to struggle with misfires like Ferngully: The Last  Rainforest and An American Tail: Fivel Goes West failing to light any fires at the box office, or foreign animations like Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland, The Princess and the Goblin, or The Magic Voyage primed for  international appeal only to fizzle out due to either distribution  problems or production issues. South London-based Hollywood Road Films  was an independent animation studio whose writer/producer/director Jon Acevski based the film off the bedtime stories he'd tell his child about  the adventures his stuffed animal frog toy had and unfortunately that  becomes really apparent. While as an animated production it doesn't carry the same weight and polish as contemporary Disney productions or  even Amblimation movies of the time like Fivel Goes West or We're Back,  it does look a cut above some animated features I've seen, but the  script is a mess and there's only so much that the bevy of high profile British talent can bring to get a purse from a Sow's ear.  


To  describe the plot of Freddie as F. R. O.7 (or Freddie the Frog as it was  called in the SGE re-edit in 1995) is akin to describing a fever dream.  What starts in a typical ""fairy tale kingdom"" goes to a jazzy community  of anthropomorphic frogs, which in turn goes to a fantastical take on  Bond/eurospy tropes and finally to borderline Star Wars type settings  that if you were to show individual stretches of this film out of  context to someone unfamiliar with it, odds are they wouldn't believe  those segments were from the same film. The movie has a very loose  narrative and that makes sense considering Acevski told these kinds of  adventure stories to his young child about his stuffed frog toy, but  that kind of loose narrative is okay when it's being told to a  half-asleep child whose age is in the low single digits and not for a  theatrical animated film that needs to have a greater sense of cohesion  for the audience to grasp onto. With its mixture of spy tropes, fairy  tale tropes, and some rather questionable innuendos, double entendres,  and some jaw dropping scenes involving (no joke) dancing Klansman and  foot soldiers dressed in Nazi chic, it's the kind of movie that's too  busy and complicated for kids to follow, but it's also too shallow and  non sensical for adults to get engaged with either. Speaking of the  dancing Klansman and Nazis, the movie is also a musical and quite a bad  one at that. Most of the songs are either bland or forgettable, and when  they do happen they're usually dead stops that do absolutely nothing to  further the story (what little there is anyway). Evilmania is the song  featuring the Klansman and Nazis and outside of the ""What!?"" factor it's  a pretty shapeless song where Billie Whiteclaw isn't even really  singing and is more speaking while the song plays with no sense of  rhythm or melody.  


I will say there's an impressive cast on paper.  The movie features an absolute dream cast of some of Britain's best  with the likes of Ben Kingsley, Brian Blessed, Jonathan Pryce, Nigel  Hawthorne, and a few others and you couldn't ask for a better line-up of  talent. Kingsley sounds like he's having fun playing up the French  ""hon! Hon! Hon!"" stereotypical voice which is like a more restrained  Pepe le Pew in terms of subtlety, but most of the other members of the  cast are just filling types and places. Nigel Hawthorne's character  Brigadier G has a particularly bad running gag of constantly getting  tangled up in phone cords and inadvertently insulting high ranking  government officials or foreign dignitaries and they do this gag four  times and it never builds upon it or does anything different with it.  Most of the set pieces that aren't related to the monument thefts just  feel like ""visual noise"" that's well animated enough I suppose, but  there's no narrative drive pushing us through these set pieces and the  emotional core is rather lacking with Messina having killed both of  Freddie's parents but Freddie doesn't seem all that engaged with her as  an antagonist.  


Freddie as F. R. O.7 has remained relatively  obscure since its financial and critical failure in 1992 and that's  rather unfortunate because while the movie doesn't work, it's utterly  fascinating in why it doesn't work. With head scratching creative  choices, a story that feels like it began as a mad lib, a cast made up  of some of Britain's finest actors, and elements like dancing Nazis and  Klansmen odds are you've never seen anything try so hard while falling  face first. In an era where many European produced animated features are  thinly veiled Shrek knock-offs there's something almost nostalgic about  movies like this that serve as a reminder of how much the animation  landscape has changed. I can't say it's ""good"" but you'll remember it.  To date the movie hasn't been released on DVD, Blu-ray, or digital  storefronts, but the film does survive from the old VHS rips on Youtube.  It's only about 79 minutes long so not a terribly costly time  investment.",movies,2,1685238562.0,0.53

"What is the most obvious, “how could they have possibly missed that?!” plot hole you’ve ever seen in a movie?","In terms of the most egregious plot hole I’ve ever seen, it absolutely has to be the one in Back to the Future.

Which Movies that made you frustrated while watching ?,"I'll start with recent GI Joe movie Snake Eyes. Great cast, could have been a great story about two friends with different ideologies. I mean they got Andrew Koji (The Warrior, Bullet Train) and Iko Uwais (Raid Redemption, The Night Comes For Us) and still dont have a single good fight sequences. The camera is shaky, the story is nonsense with making Snake Eyes the actual backstabber than Storm Shadow. I mean let the actors do their job and keep your camera still and keep the story simple. How hard it is to make a good ninja martial arts action movie? Watch Scott Adkins Ninja series, with such a low budget those two movies are pretty good.

If Best Picture was decided by Critics Polls (1940-2021),"Roughly 7 years ago u/TheGreatZiegfeld did an experiment of a post to determine what the best films of each year would be from 1940 to 2011 (before the 2012 S&S polls).

With the recently updated TSPDT and the 2022 S&S list, I decided to do the same from 1940 to 2021 regarding what critics thought were the best of each year.

Keep in mind this is all from a critics' poll, not from one specific critic's list. Also no short films or miniseries (meaning no Twin Peaks or Meshes of the Afternoon), as well as those from 2022 and beyond because of the last S&S poll.

Silver Linings Playbook,"A movie about a person dealing with bipolar disorder, and how he tries to get over his relationship problems witb his wife is the core premise of the film.

The best thing about the film is the performance of two leading protagonists, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. Bradley Cooper was great while potraying the minor quips of a person dealing with mental disorders, and Jennifer Lawrence during her outbursts was a highlight. It was a respectable potrayal of mental illness, as per my research. 

There was a lack of score in the film, which I think kinda lent the movie an unsettling feeling to the film.

I mean for once the name of the movie is totally appropriate.

Or think of the movie Uncut Gems, which is obviously not about a particular emotion, yet the camera movement, the music, the voices, the pace....everything combines to create a kind of unpleasant stressful or agitated feeling in you the whole movie.

Random rant: Movies are too long now.,"I am 51 and growing up most movies were 90-120 minutes. If a movie approached 120 or went over they were telling some type of epic story and they had an intermission.


Now everything is just too dam long, poor writing, over explaining... The fact that as I get older I seem to need to piss more often does not help.


Also, studios seem to be going back and editing older movies to include cut scenes. Conan the Barbarian (the 1st one) was and still is one of my favorite movies, but a version I purchased seems to include scenes that are not in the original movie. I most likely purchased a director cut and not realized it.. but man it is annoying.

Lightyear was a straight up dud and among Pixar’s worst movies, and if the early Cannes reactions are anything to go by elemental is going to be similarly poor.

The Platform: Clarifications about the platform itself,"Before I start, I encourage anyone who hasn’t watched it to give it a go. Interesting one. Spoilers ahead.

Now, everyday the platform lowers each floor where there is a live person for some time, then descends again. It goes back up after it has reached the bottom. 

So what does Miharu do? As I understand it, she searches for her daughter and goes down levels, killing people sometimes. 

1) I assume she goes back up every few days. So she just gets off and starts at the first floor?

2) if she does do this, wouldn’t everyone else eventually do this? Ride to the bottom, then go straight up to the top floors where you have all the food. 

2) if she doesn’t go back up at the bottom, how does she survive since the lower you go, the less food you get?",movies,7,1685182214.0,0.6

What if Mike Myers starred in The Mask instead of Jim Carrey?,"Would the film have been better?

I can't be too certain since the sources are a bit sketchy but apparently, Mike Myers, already on top of the world with his legendary run on SNL and Wayne's World, was one of the original choices for the lead role in The Mask, the 1994 comedy (*very* loosely) based on the comic book of the same name. The role, instead, went to a then-unknown Jim Carrey, and the rest is history. But it really makes you wonder how Mike Myers would have handled the role.

See, both are completely different performers. Myers is more about wit and character while Carrey is more slapstick and gross-out. Not to say Myers doesn't dwell onto that occasionally but he's not famous for that as much as Carrey is. Carrey was clearly going for a Tex Avery style. I don't think Myers would have went with the slapstick but he would have been wacky in the way Chuck Jones' work was. Subtle yet effective. 

I don't know, what do you think?",movies,0,1685255297.0,0.32
Weird Connections Between Two Movies….,"You know that really bizarre  feeling you get when you feel like there are two things that have some kind of deeper connection that is most likely to be coincidental but feels to you like it's just way too close to be, but you just can’t seem to narrow down what that is (and that maybe only you seem to notice)? 

Well, for years there are two movies that to me have so many subtle similarities which make me think there is sone kind of grander connection between them than just what can be revealed through cast/crew lists and visual style but try as I might I just can't pin down the source of what that is. These two movies are Mamoru Hosoda's 'The Girl Who Leapt Through Time' and Studio Ghibli's 'The Cat Returns'. 

Thinking about or watching either one of these movies always makes me think of the other. The plots and themes are obviously totally different, but so many things are weirdly similar. The character designs (especially of Haru and the other high schoolers) look super similar; the high school Haru goes to (down to even her classroom) looks almost identical to that which Makoto goes to; the houses of the main character look super similar; the overall animation style and visual areas in which particular levels of detail are applied is very reminiscent; even the semi-exaggerated expressions of 'The Cat Returns' are more along the lines of those in 'The Girl Who Leapt Through Time' (I know these are common in anime, but it seems like there's almost a particular grade of it here that's not super mild nor super strong).

I honestly don't know why this is the case. I mean, I know that Hosoda was at Ghibli for a time (cause he was originally going to do 'Howl's Moving Castle' and potentially, in the eyes of Miyazaki, become an heir to head the company after the retirement/death of the Ghibli founders, but creative differences between him and Toshio Suzuki pretty much destroyed that), but I doubt that that has anything to do with these subtle and not-so-subtle similarities (unless I'm wrong, which I totally could be).

"What movies/franchises from the sci-fi genre did you did you find later in life, while others knew them way better? And which did you find earlier in your life considering your age?","Being born right at the beginning of the 90s outside of the series you'd think I'd have known Star Trek inside and out, same with Star Wars....but especially with Star Wars I didn't catch up until my mid 20's, personal choice after only seen the prequels. Which mind you I didn't ""mind"" but nothing to make me sit through 9+ films. Star Trek however became an addiction movie wise, then I was shocked when I learned films like Final Frontier wasn't in the normal of being considered ""trekkie"" enough or just good in any-way. Btw at that point in life I had seen Original Series and TNG in their completion. Anywho - **Alien(s) and Terminator** were my childhood franchises, my mother hated the f bomb but allowed cable so I was lucky on that - sadly from an adult perspective I must not have really known much as so much was edited out, to the point so was their stories. Forward in time to 2003 and I was let down that Alien was ""dead"" (the internet even then didn't put much trust in AvP) and Terminator 3 was a disaster (except I kinda liked what I saw at age 13-20 years later at age 33 its ok too). But yeah Alien/Terminator really got me into the genre of sci-fi but mysteriously they borderline on horror, which I know is obvious but I at the time say 1998 when I saw them on cable didn't see that.

Babylon>>> Avatar way of water,To be honest i was more excited for avatar2 than Babylon. Of course who wasn’t. But it was not a good film.

On the other hand even though my expectations weren’t as high as for Avatar was i still was hyped because of Damien chazelle..i knew what kind of movie i was in for and it delivered. The first one hour alone was whole movie for me. I cheered and laughed when “manny” got the camera and “Jack” scene could be shot before sunset. There were lot of emotional scenes. The movie casually reminded how toxic it can be in Hollywood. So many lives brought up and soon to be destroyed and the depression….omg! Babylon deserves more appreciation according to me. And saw many people criticising about the “commercial acting” in the film. And the ending of the movie is something else. I literally had tears in my eyes just like “manny” 🤌🏻🤌🏻.

What would be your team for a The Expendables reboot in 2030?,"I followed four rules, feel free to ignore them, but was more fun for me that way.

1. Team size should be 6 as in the original movie.
2. Average age of the team must be around 42 today, would be 49 in 2030, which was the average age of the team in the original The Expendables 2010 (oldest was Stallone at 65, youngest was Terry Crews at 41).
3. Can't have been in a previous The Expendables movie.
4. Must have a solid track record according to their age.

**Here's mine (average age 43 today):**

\- **Keanu Reeves:** oldest of the team, needs no introduction.

\- **Ryan Reynolds:** Deadpool movies and a pretty consistent string of smaller but but solid movies like 6 Underground, Hitman's Bodyguard or Smokin' Aces.

\- **Chris Hemsworth:** there were similar options around his age like Chris Evans, but picked Hemsworth because beyond Marvel he's also pushing heavy-hitting franchises like Mad Max (upcoming Furiosa) and Tyler Rake.

\- **Zang Ziyi:** House of Flying Daggers + Hero + Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

\- **Michael B. Jordan:** still young but already been in Black Panther, the Creed franchise (directed the third) and is set to star as a second Tom Clancy character in the upcoming Rainbow Six movie.

\- **Florian Munteanu:** the team needs some younger members just like the first movie and I also like that he's a real boxer, just like Randy Couture was an MMA fighter. You also get the two Rocky characters like in the first movie (Stallone and Dolph).

The use of depth of field in the Anne Hathaway Les Misérables ‘I Dreamed A Dream’ scene always blows me away. It truly compliments the scene.,"One of the most powerful scenes in Les Misérables is when Anne Hathaway sings 'I Dreamed A Dream'. The camera focuses on her face and blurs the background, creating a depth of field effect that enhances the emotion of the song. The depth of field makes us feel like we are in her mind, witnessing her despair and regret. It also isolates her from the rest of the world, showing how alone and hopeless she is. The use of depth of field in this scene is a brilliant example of how cinematography can support the story and the performance.

Final Destination 1-5 ❤️,"My girlfriend didn't watch many horror movies growing up, so I am currently taking her through some of my favorites during our downtime while travelling. We recently watched all the Final Destination movies, and she said that she for the first time understood people's fascination with ridiculous death scenes and that she had so much fun watching them 😂☠️

I think it is the best horror movie franchise out there, as all the movies still hold up, except for the 3D movie, The Final Destination, which has some of the worst effects you will ever see in a blockbuster movie. Also the premonitions in that movie sucked 😩 It almost ruined the franchise, but luckily the final movie brought it back from the dead! 

It is probably the second and the final movies of the series  that have the best deaths, while the first movie was the most grounded ❤️

"Lifetimes version of ""Where the Heart Is"" edits an entire plotline out and I'm not sure how I feel.","I'm stuck with actual network TV in a hotel, which in itself is super weird, but instead of cracking open the laptop and streaming something I flipped around and saw that Lifetime was showing Where The Heart Is. If you haven't seen this movie, you should. It is a full-on fever dream of a flick, full of Academy award nominees (three or four of them, no shit), that weaves it's way between plotlines like a Nissan Altima lane shopping it's way through rush hour traffic. This includes Stockard Channing repeatedly asking for God to forgive her fornication, Sally Fields being a total cunt for like four minutes, and a performance from Ashley Judd that is honestly so good this movie doesn't deserve it. Also, if you haven't seen it, maybe stop reading here.

So, the Lifetime edit of this movie starts off normal, in a trailer park in Tennessee with a pregnant Novalee (Portman) and her sleazeball boyfriend Willy-Jack heading off to California. He eventually leaves her at the Wal-Mart because he's a terrible person, but then we take a left turn into a dimension where Willy-Jack stops existing. In the non-Lifetime cut we get a rambling storyline of Willy-Jack's fall into crime, his rise to country music stardom, and his eventual second fall beneath a railcar where he loses his legs. All of this is interspersed into Novalee's story, which is full of a billion storylines itself. Lifetime, either because they wanted to focus on the female empowerment side of the story by solely focusing on Novalee and how she overcomes all her challenges, or because Willy-Jack's just an asshole, cut through all that story and left it right there on the network editing room floor.

Cutting out this storyline even includes cutting out one of the academy award nominees by giving Joan Cusack the boot, which honestly, as good as she is, doesn't affect the movie all that much. Novalee and Willy-Jacks storylines collide again at the end of the movie, providing a reason for Novalee to go seek out her real love interest and fulfill the romance happy ending. Lifetime's version still includes this scene but the viewer is left to imagine poor Willy Jack's life was just a descent into shit that ended up with him somehow losing his legs. It's hard to make this movie more confusing, but Lifetime succeeded.

I'm unsure of how I feel about Lifetime cutting close to an hour out of a two hour long movie to make way for commercials. Especially when that almost hour contains an entire plotline in an already convoluted movie. It definitely feels more like a Lifetime movie through foregoing Willy-Jacks hijinks and honing in on Novalee and the female struggles she and her clutch endure. It was a bit of a shock when I realized how superficial that storyline was and the movie loses almost nothing of tangible value by removing it. It still functions as a light romance with a few good performances. However, by becoming that much more of a romance and that less of a weird rambling mess of a movie it definitely loses most of what made it watchable in the first place. Now it's just another romance female empowerment movie that ends with all the women getting the men in their lives (including Stockard finally getting to God).",movies,0,1685161015.0,0.38

Thoughts on US v Paramount and it's impact on the industry?,"In case you didn't know, prior to 1948, a handful of companies controlled a large amount of the film industry, or to quote a book, from 1948 regarding centralization of media: 

""In the United States the motion picture industry, like the press and radio, shows an increasing trend towards centralization. The bulk of the production has been controlled by five companies (Loew's or MGM, Paramount, RKO, Twentieth Century-Fox, and Warner Brothers) and three satellites (Columbia, Universal, and United Artists). These eight companies: 

1. Produce ordinarily over 50 percent of all pictures and almost all of those expensive pictures which draw large audiences and are most profitable
2. Have contracts with the most popular actors and actresses
3. **Own or control the theaters** which attract the bulk of the box-office receipts
4. Possess important interests in music publishers, recording companies, and ratio stations. When television looked as a rival, they began to invest in this medium.""

The Paramount decision in 1948 stopped film companies from owning exhibition companies, important to stop the centralization of the industry. But, in 2020, this policy was effectively reversed, under the assumption that the antitrust restriction would no longer be necessary. Do you believe this to be true?

"This is my first time watching Apocalypto, I wanna know other peoples opinions","Hi! So this movie has obviously been out for obviously a really long time. And I finally knocked it off my list. I don't have anyone to chat with about it since it's not current. 

So I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it, I think im like 50/50. Historical inaccuracies aside, there are things I don't love and things I loved. It's obviously a fun adventure and action story. I really can go in on how many things they got wrong historically, but ill save it.

Things I likes: 

\- I really liked the casting and that the entire movie is not in English, 

\- the costumes and everything was great 

\- I had no problem with the acting, they all did a great job

There were moments that I went back and forth between feeling like I'm watching something that is a period piece and watching like an epic fantasy. I think specifically when they are at the city center, it was hard to stay in belief. I am thinking it's because of all the historical inaccuracies possibly. The feeling of the story felt so all over the place at times and didn't fully make sense. Also, that scene was such a mess with some of the things that were going on. 

I enjoyed it, not to sound too much like a hater. There were just moments (also I'm not the biggest fan of Mel Gibson)

"Was STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN (1982) the first ever ""soft reboot"" attempt?","My thinking is a ""sequel"" is a continuation of the storyline with the same characters.

A ""hard reboot"" is starting the story all over again with new actors and new vision.

A ""soft reboot"" is a sequel that occurs many years later, features the same actors/characters, but acts somewhat as a springboard for a younger cast, typically the children of the original aging characters.

STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN (1982) featured the original cast ... Kirk, Spock, and so on ... facing off against and older vengeful Khan.

So it's clearly a straight sequel.

However, it features a young cast ... Kirk's son David.  Spock's protégée Saavik, Scotty's nephew Peter ... and Khan's protege Joachim.

Granted some of the young cast members didn't make it to the end of the film, and they didn't end up taking over the lead roles ... but I wonder if that might've been an early intention by producers ... to have a ""new Kirk"" and a ""new Spock"" to join the cast in case Shatner and Nimoy moved away from the franchise.

So I am wondering, is STAR TREK II the first ever movie to -- at least attempt -- to do a ""soft reboot""?",movies,0,1685150619.0,0.35

Palm Springs [2020] and existentialism,"i did a course on existentialism and the final assignment was to choose a work of art and analyze it with existentialism in mind, so i thought id share my assignment.

  

Palm Springs is a movie with a similar concept to the famous movie ""Groundhog Day"". The movie follows the characters Sarah and Nyles. Sarah's family is at a resort preparing for her sister's wedding. During the wedding, Sarah notices that one of the guests, Nyles, is acting strangely: He wears a Hawaiian shirt to a wedding and generally does whatever he wants without a care in the world. They strike up a conversation and leave the resort to be alone. Suddenly, he is shot by a mysterious person. Sarah chases after the injured Nyles and unfortunately gets caught in a time loop, she wakes up back in the same bed she woke up in that morning. 

Sarah, Nyles and Roy are the three characters who experience this loop, and each of them responds to it differently and in my opinion each character represents a different view of the meaning of existence. Nyles thinks like a pessimistic nihilist, ""Today, tomorrow, yesterday, it's all the same"" he says, there is no meaning to anything we do so why do it. The viewer isn’t aware of the amount of time Nyles experienced in the loop but from Nyles's behavior it can be assumed he has been in the loop for months or even years.No matter what he did, even if he took drugs or ran away to another country, he eventually returns to the starting point with nothing changed which caused him to reach the conclusion that nothing matters . The biggest example of that is his shirt, in every loop we can see that he wears a Hawaiian shirt to the wedding ceremony it shows that any meaning whether it's of the social event he attends or the thoughts of the people there don’t matter in his eyes. Nyles's nihilism can be seen again when he explained to Sarah that a person's past doesn’t matter after Sarah asked about his time before the loop.

Roy, who gets into the loop after Nyles led him there  and lives through the loop almost the same amount of time as Nyles, comes to a slightly different conclusion - existentialism, first Roy abused Nyles. he killed him, shot him, burned him alive, and tried to take revenge on him for the cruel fate Nyles imposed on him. After many incidents, Roy realizes that no matter what he does to Nyles or Sarah, nothing will change. After many  loops, when Nyles travels to Roy's house, Roy tells him that he realized that he has a good life, a beautiful wife, a big house, and two happy children. Roy adds that although he will not get to see his daughter marry, his life is good, and he does not want to give it up. Roy knows there is no meaning to his life, after all the day repeats itself without an end in sight, but he decided that his meaning is his family. He will live with them on the good day he is stuck on. Roy has given meaning to his meaningless life.

And finally we have Sarah, the absurd. She has just entered the loop and therefore she is still having a hard time with the new reality she has fallen into. At first, she is affected by Nyles and thinks that nothing matters, but she tries to find a way out, even after she gave up on getting out and continuing life in the loop, she and Nyles do everything they can to find meaning, similar to the myth of Sisyphus. She understands that there is no meaning in anything but nonetheless continues to look for a meaning. Whether it's celebrating Nyles' millionth birthday or pretending to be a villain and planting a bomb in the wedding cake. While Nyles stays away from everyone and avoids socializing and his problems, Sarah internalizes her past and continues to search for improvements to give meaning to the time she has spent in the loop.

The Myth of Sisyphus is a philosophical essay by Albert Camus. The essay is about Sisyphus - a man who was sent to the underworld after his death. Sisyphus meets a god in the underworld, only to lie and persuade the god to let him return to the world of the living. Sisyphus was successful with his plan, but after he died of old age. The god punished Sisyphus by condemning him to roll a boulder from the base of a mountain to the top. The boulder will always roll downward, so the task will always be in vain. 

In a scene at the end of the movie, Sarah and Nyles have managed to get out of the loop at this point. Their actions should have meaning now, but in my opinion the movie is trying to show that there is no meaning after all. This scene shows this in two ways, one is that even though they have gotten out of the loop, they have returned to the pool where they spent a lot of time while they were in the loop, even though they were desperately trying to escape, they still ended up in the same place. In this scene Nyles wears the same Hawaiian shirt he wore to the wedding while he was in the loop further showing them continuing the theme of repeating actions and showing that escaping didn't change anything. It can be understood that even now nothing has any meaning. Second, Sarah gasps when Nyles mentions that he has a dog, Sarah makes it seem like this is a big revelation. She asks him why he didn’t  tell her something so important, which I think shows that Sarah is still searching for meaning, because the fact that Nyles has a dog is not important, yet she gives it meaning.

Sarah's actions can be compared to those of Sisyphus. He kept rolling the rock up the mountain, a person on his journey to find meaning, even in simple things like owning a dog, though he knows it is a futile effort, so Sarah can only accept the fact that life has no meaning, accept it and rejoice. As it says in the last paragraph of the myth

""I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always finds one's burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy "" (Camus, 1942)

In conclusion, the movie uses a scenario we have seen in other movie, life in an infinite loop, to show three different perspectives: Nyles argues that nothing has meaning, Roy says that nothing has meaning and therefore it is our job to give our existence meaning and Sarah says that life itself is a meaningless chase for meaning, but as long as one accepts that fact, one can be happy. And in my opinion the movies final cat ultimately shows that absurdism is the correct choice.",movies,2,1685081233.0,0.54

Does anyone hate School of Rock also?,"It's been on my watch list for years, and it has been a total disappointment, especially Jack Black's performance. I think he's a horrible actor, way over the top, and there's something very fake about it, like he doesn't mean a single word he's saying. Plus the faces he makes while singing or his singing itself, perhaps he's voice isn't bad, but when he's making up a song adding what the kids say, it's just so ugly, that riff he plays.

Robert Pattinson’s performance in Good Time,"I know this one came out a while ago now but I watched it for the first time a few months ago and I felt the need to start a conversation about Pattinson’s incredible portrayal of Connie. 

It’s that blank stare on his face that he maintains for a big portion of the movie. If you google still shots from Good Time, you’ll see it right away. He has this look on his face as if he is mentally removed from the reality of his situation and everyone in it. Connie has such tunnel vision, going from one place to the next using people as an ends to a mean that when he looks at people (other than his brother, who Benny Safdie did a great job playing) it’s as if he doesn’t even see them as people. In the “I’m better than you” scene, this takes a real shape.

I think i have a theory on why Disney makes the live action remakes of their animated films.,"Have you seen most their live action output in the 2010’s and how some of them underperformed or flat out bombed at the box office? 

Like Tron legacy underperformed for example and the movies that Disney thought they were going to be their next “Pirates” style franchise like The Lone Ranger, John Carter and Prince of Persia all bombed spectacularly and even the one shots like A Wrinkle in Time and The Nutcracker all bombed 

Then there’s the mid budget stuff that they did make like Saving Mr. Banks and Mcfarland USA which they got good reviews from critics and did make their money back domestically but they weren’t big moneymakers.  

And since obviously since Disney can’t shut down the live action division they decided to say fuck it and just remake a bunch of their animated films for quick easy profit.

And the sad part is that they still make mid budget films but they get dumped and buried on Disney+. Even if the film’s actually good, too bad they get terribly treated and used as filler for their streaming service. It’s sad too because there’s still an audience for the mid budget stuff, too bad Disney doesn’t think that anymore as they got spoiled with Marvel and Lucasfilm",movies,0,1685131924.0,0.23
"Animated Films Similar To ""Koyaanisqatsi""?","One of my favorite films of all time is the 1982 documentary ""Koyaanisqatsi,"" a film about the more interesting parts of the world we live in. Of course, I also love films like ""Samsara"" or ""Baraka,"" just to name a few, but there's just something that makes Koyaanisqatsi stand out from the rest.

Now -with that being said- I'm also a fan of animated movies, and with me recently watching ""Weathering With You"" just yesterday, it sparked my interest. Are there any animated films that are similar to ""Koyaanisqatsi"" in anyway way? The reason this came into my mind is because of the many scenes in ""Weathering With You"" in which it shows the city landscape of Tokyo in a sort of dream scape way.

'No Hard Feelings' (2023) - Am I alone in thinking the premise is 'wrong'?,"I'm no prude, to be honest. Not at all. But I'm a queer guy - so maybe I just don't 'get' that maybe the stuff in this film's trailers is considered okay in heterosexual relationships.

But, from my perspective - I can't help but feel the premise and behavior of Jennifer Lawrence's character is kind of gross? And even if that's the 'joke', it's sending the wrong message.

I mean, imagine a film where a 34 year old man is hired to take the v-card of 19 year old girl, and grinds on her and does crazy/dumb things to seduce her, when she's clearly uncomfortable (as the young guy in this trailer is). And goes to a high school party, and bursts into rooms looking for the girl he's after, violating privacy of high school teenagers whom he thought they were getting intimate with.

That film would never, ever, be made in 2023.

We see Percy, the 19 year old guy, wants the woman pursuing him to stop doing so. She doesn't. She grinds on him when it's of course awkward - because he doesn't want it and is uncomfortable.

It's just a little gross, to me. 

And tone-deaf if we're trying to get better as a society about consent, overall. I've taught in my career on consent to teens, too - and the trailers for this just raised a lot of red flags, for me.

Not to mention, the age-gap. The power dynamics of a 15 year age-gap is pretty big, too. And again, flip the sexes - and I think many articles would be blasting this film.

I understand there's a context for male characters to pursue much younger women in film and they've also been fuzzy at best on consent, at times.

But I don't feel that a course-correction where the script is flipped with a sex-swap, is the best course of action - rather than the death of this story trope, altogether. 

I don't know.

With consent being such a huge topic in recent years and a more widespread understanding of boundaries - I can't help but feel this film is a bit...gross?",movies,0,1685118806.0,0.39

Apparently it bombed and had terrible reviews.  I'm just confused as to what the heck they were thinking.  Were they somehow unaware that there was another film releasing under the same name?  Was it deliberate and trying to masquerade/ride the coattails of the other film?

Please tell me I'm not the only one so annoyed by John wick 4 plot and story,"I absolutely loved the action and thrill in the movie just like the last 3 but the plot is just annoying.

So John survived at the end of Parabellum. Then he came back to fight the table. He kills the elder so the table kills pyotr. Then Vincent comes to kill him. Destroys the the NY continental and kills charon. Brings Caine back into the game from his ""retirement"" to have him kill John. Shimazu dies defending John and Akira. Akira seeks revenge. Osaka continental is demolished too I assume. Then he challenges and kills the marquis for Caine's freedom and his own and for Winston to get his hotel back. Gets his freedom and DIES. And in the post credits we see Akira going for Caine.
If we assume Akira kills Caine,

In a nutshell, three friends of John die(charon, shimazu and caine(assumption)), NY continental destroyed(rebuild at the end), Osaka continental destroyed(assumption), Akira and Mia lost their dads. Just so that John dies a freeman in sunrise and not because he fell down a building.

The way CGI is used for period landscapes/environments,"I was watching Wilde (1997), which is an 1800s period piece, and it has multiple wide shots of period-appropriate towns and cities (including big ones like London), and I was struck by how much of it seemed to be practical.

I couldn’t stop thinking that if it’d been filmed today, the opening shots (for instance) of an 1880s Colorado mining town would have been entirely CGI, filmed either in a soundstage or an empty desert valley with the actual period-appropriate structures computer generated later. 

It made me realise that the effectiveness of imagery in every recent period film I’ve seen has been reliant on whether they did the CGI well, because they almost never use practical effects for large shots regardless of budget. A mid-budget movie like Wilde in the 1990s could open on a wide shot of a Wild West town without looking wonky or fake (or dated in the future).

I guess what I’m saying is - people complain about over-reliance of CGI for action shots, monster/creature effects, stunts etc but this is the most obnoxious part of it for me. Most CGI looks ok nowadays, but sometimes a movie will use CGI backdrops for some random outdoor shot just so they don’t have to rely on weather or production design and it drives me crazy because it still doesn’t look exactly (although David Fincher uses it subtly and well in Mindhunter and Zodiac).",movies,8,1685008648.0,0.59

The dialogues are spoken in Tagalog so I can't understand a single thing. I need subtitles but when I checked Open Subtitle and Subscene there were only one subtitle for this film and that was Arabic. 

Then I found an uploaded version of the film on YouTube with English subtitle but it's hardsub. It is synced with the movie itself

I know the movie has an English subtitle. Any ideas where I can find the simple srt version? I can delete my own file and then download the YouTube one instead but that is my last option",movies,0,1685047810.0,0.44

But it’s been like 6-7 years  since then and really nothing has came about .

"For Some Reason, I Find Shrek Incredibly Frightening","This may be literally the stupidest post ever, but I need to know if anyone else feels this way. I find Shrek (the character) incredibly frightening. It's not a physical thing, because his design is rather goofy and silly. It's also not personality or story wise, which makes this even weirder. I can't say specifically why he's frightening to me, there's something about him that I can't put into words. 

For example, I was watching a youtube video earlier about lost media. One of these was the search of a lost Shrek commercial promoting a camera or something. The only thing they had about that commercial was a screenshot that was used as a meme. The one that goes "" \*snap\* yep, this one's going in my cringe compilation"" or something along those words. Supposedly, it is very popular, but i've never heard of it before. The second I saw that image, I got the worst and weirdest feeling ever. As I said, I cannot describe it at all. I've tried before, but it's just very hard for me. The only way I can try to show what I mean is through Liminal Spaces. This feeling that seeing Shrek gives me is the same one I get from seeing Liminal Spaces. It's a weird phenomenon, since Liminal Space pictures are meant to give you that feeling, but Shrek is nowhere near that. Also (I feel like i should've mentioned this earlier on the post) I feel this way by pictures (pictures only, no videos or gifs or whatever) that depict just Shrek. If it shows Shrek with Fiona, Puss In Boots, Donkey, etc.. I don't feel weird at all. 

Okay, i'm sorry if my way of describing this sucks. It's just a very specific thing that, for now, only happens to me, so I tried my best. And, as I mentioned, it's a really weird feeling that cannot be put into words. Well, I hope someone also suffers from this or I will feel embarrased lmao.",movies,0,1685063287.0,0.48

"How long is to long, when waiting to watch something with a friend? When your friend makes you wait so you can watch it together.","For you movie/show lovers out there, and people who like watching things with friends or companions.  I have an issue that has been bothering me.

I have a roommate/friend that I live with, and we will often watch things together.  We have similar interests in stuff, and want to watch the same things.  However, this sometimes leads to problems.  For example, we recently started watching The Expanse.  We are both enjoying it and we finished season 1.  Now I want to watch season 2.  That was a month ago.  Every few days I ask him if he wants to watch an episode or two, and he will say, ""Im not feeling it, we can watch it later.""  And this happens until I start to lose my patience.  I end up asking if we are ever going to watch it, and it turns into an argument, he calls me impatient, and eventually I go watch it on my own. Then he gets really angry at me for watching it without him.

This ends up happening a lot.  He STILL hasnt watched season 2 of Stranger Things.  If I had waited for him, I would have not seen it yet either.

So whats the deal?  What is proper movie watching etiquette?  How long am I supposed to wait to watch something, that I am excited and eager to watch?

Is it wrong of me to want him to put a little more effort and time into watching a show?  He always says hes to tired from work and just wants to play video games and relax.  Which is fine, I play games to relax sometimes too.  But when I have to wait a whole month or longer to watch the next episode of a show Im enjoying, it really pisses me off.  And then he acts like Im the badguy when I lose my patience and bring up how long Ive been waiting, or when I watch it on my own.",movies,0,1685069331.0,0.35
Need Recommendations! Watching 365 movies this year!,"As the title says, I'm watching 365 movies in 2023 and I'm 157 in. My idea train is getting stale, so I'm looking for any and all recommendations. I'll post my current list below. At the end of the year I'll include my one line opinions on each of the movies.

I have almost no criteria, other than I waver towards films I can watch *while* doing something else. Therefore, you'll probably notice there are not a ton of non-English language movies. That's not because I'm above them, and I do love foreign language films. But the time I have to watch a movie generally is while working out or getting some work done.

You will notice my trajectory on movie choices goes in streaks - Disaster movies (my favorite), art house films, monster flicks, dark comedies, thrillers, etc. So by no means do I have one particular thread I'm going down. I'll also say just because it's not on this list doesn't mean I've not watched it, so please still recommend it, but know that if it's on the AFI list chances are good I've seen it.

My streaming services (and also, I'm good with renting):  
Amazon Prime, Paramount+, Netflix, Max (HBO), Disney+, Criterion

So I Finally Watched Lolita (1997)....,"*Spoiler warning just in case*




Ahhhh good God this movie makes me uncomfortable. I've seen a fair share of uncomfortable, ""banned"" movies, but ughh this one just rubs me the wrong way. They toned the sexuality up A LOT compared to the older movie. They make Mr Hambert Hamburger Kid Diddler look much younger and fitter for some reason. They make Dolores wear all these skantily clad outfits. What makes me like it and hate it at the same time is that she actually looks and acts like a fourteen year old. She acts like a kid. They don't try to dress her up or make her act more mature in any way, they present her how she actually is; a child. They make some scenes in this film incredibly uncomfortably realistic and I have to look away sometimes. The way the angles of her legs and feet and butt are presented make me feel incredibly icky. Don't get be started on the KISSING SCENES. 🤮
I know it's shown from Hambert's perspective, so who knows what the reality of the situation looks like, but god....
Even the way she supposedly acts ""seductive"" reminds me of when I was that age and my friends and I were curious about our own sexualities. It's not seductiveness....it's natural curiosity. And the way he takes advantage of that and deludes himself into thinking she's capable of desiring him in that way...that she's capable of consenting and fully comprehending the gravity of her choices. The romantic music that plays whenever she's sexualized.....as if it's supposed to seem wholesome and romantic... Honestly I'm just wondering about the actress(es) who played Dolores.....It makes me feel a bit icky when I think about child stars, but it especially makes me wonder for her/their well-being in this context.

Comparing Naked Gun and Austin Powers,"As those old enough to know remember, Naked Gun and Austin Powers were the James Bond parodies of the 90s. 

But they feel massively different from each other. Naked Gun was made from 1989-93 and Austin Powers from 1997-2002.

The first feels like it’s from the 60s and 70s in terms of mores and worldview. The second feels like it could have been made.. early to late 2000s

Both are massively sexist and dated and couldn’t be made today. 

What did you think about them? Do you think they could be made now? Could characters names “ mini me” or “ fat bastard” ever get reception from  sensitive  and PC audiences?

What’s funny enough is that people almost never talk about them now. There are no talks of reboots, no references, no callbacks. They aren’t part of the cultural memory, few t shirts, memes etc.

A list of movies in chronological order,"I think if such a list was to exist it would be fancinating. And basically impossible for one person to make. 

The list I am talking about is a list of all films (or at least as many as possible) listed in order of the time period they are depicted to take place. 

Now obviously many films take place over a long periods of time. For example 2001 a space odyssey shows scenes from the early evolution of mankind as well as 2001...  So where would it be placed on the list? Very early or quite late on the list? Or both?... I don't know. So I guess there would have to be a set of rules to state how the list works.

Anyone have suggestions of how it could be done? Or rules that would help it come together? I am not saying I am going to make such a list. But if many people were interested in working together in making one it would be amazing.",movies,1,1685017385.0,0.52
I feel more confused about Do The Right Thing (1989) after watching Spike Lee's interviews.,"I thought the message was clear: it's difficult to understand people from different backgrounds, but we should all ""cool it down."" Like we weren't necessarily supposed to blindly side with the Black community, but we were supposed to view the movie in the context of the Black community.

Mookie gives Sal's younger son an advice regarding his violent brother, and he responds: ""you don't have a brother like me, you'll never understand."" When Mookie tells him that he too has a sister, he responds: ""Yeah but it's not the same thing."" I think this is a core message of the film.

Sal is not a hateful racist, but he loves black people in a patronizing way, so I get why he is a racist character. I think him only having Italian heroes on his wall symbolizes how difficult it is to fully understand people from a different background no matter how much time you spend near them. That's why Mookie and Sal are the only three-dimensional characters, as they are sort of cultural ambassadors for their communities, while other characters are caricatures of different types of people.

The whole montage of people hating on different races also prove my point to some degree. We ""other"" people from different races.

Buggin Out feels victimized and wants to be understood by the mainstream society. That's why he wants the pictures of his people on the wall. As misdirected as his anger is, I feel like his anger and his desire for representation are valid.

It all goes to shit when Radio Raheem, a stupid and unlikeable thug, joins the movement. He makes it hard for everyone to hear each other with his loud music and makes them all scream at each other aggressively. I think the loud music is a metaphor for this type of behavior. Yeah his life matters more than Sal's insured property, but remember how Radio Raheem was going to choke Sal to death over his boombox? How racist and condescending he was towards the Asians? Sal had nothing to do with his death to be honest.

At the ending, Mookie decides to side with his community, and asks Sal for payment even though he was partly responsible for the destruction of his property. But I guess you gotta do what you gotta do, as Sal did what he had to do.

This was my understanding of the film anyways, but actually listening to Spike Lee's interviews about this film makes it sound like it was way less nuanced/deep than I initially thought? Like you were supposed to side with Mookie and feel bad for Radio Raheem while not caring about Sal's property?

But if the goal was to make people pick a side and specifically choose the Black community, why the symbolistic dialogues? Why have all the caricature characters like Radio Raheem? Why place a picture of black activists on the wall of a destroyed building, where the pictures of Italians were, like it's some sort of metaphor for understanding? Why spend so much time building up Sal's and his sons' characters?

Am I missing something? Or was this movie not as good at conveying its intended message as people think it is?

Like I like it as a social commentary movie that doesn't pick a side, but it's just a terribly-made movie if Spike Lee wanted me to pick a side and I can't look past it.",movies,0,1685060617.0,0.42
"Looking for futuristic movies that AREN'T ""technology bad""","I don't know how else to title this.

"Let's discuss spam, spammers, and the spamming spammers who spam.","What did the moderator say to the subscribers?

Nobody knows, because nobody ever reads what moderators write.

------

Yes, it was a bad joke, but at least it wasn't a repost... which is *kind of* what we're here to discuss today:

As many of you are no doubt aware, spammers and bad actors have been flooding Reddit lately, and /r/Jokes has started to get hit pretty hard. Dealing with the issue isn't as easy as it sounds, though, because any action that we take has the potential to affect good-faith users. Still, we've been discussing the problem, and we've come up with the beginnings of a solution: 

We're going to ban every last one of our subscribers.

Just kidding! In fact, we're going to give you a bit more insight into how spammers work, what their goals are, and why they're so effective on Reddit. This information will be included on [our complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/wiki/index), which we've also streamlined and updated. (The rules themselves haven't changed; we've just made them a bit clearer and more condensed.) Our hope is that you'll be able to recognize and report spammers when you see them, which will help us keep them from gaining more of a foothold here.

We'll be taking some other anti-spam actions behind the scenes, so rest assured, we aren't trying to dump the spam-fighting on you. We just figured that it was better to keep everyone informed... because after all, /r/Jokes is a community, and a community is only as smart as its dumbest member.

(Yes, the moderators count as members, and yes, we're easily the dumbest.)

Squirrels and Religion,"Squirrels and Religion

The Presbyterian church called a meeting to decide what to do about their squirrel infestation.  After much prayer and consideration, they concluded that the squirrels were predestined to be there, and they should not interfere with God’s divine will.

 

At the Baptist church, the squirrels had taken an interest in the baptistry.  The deacons met and decided to put a water-slide on the baptistry and let the squirrels drown themselves.  The squirrels liked the slide and, unfortunately, knew instinctively how to swim, so twice as many squirrels showed up the following week.

 

The Lutheran church decided that they were not in a position to harm any of God’s creatures.  So, they humanely trapped their squirrels and set them free near the Baptist church.  Two weeks later, the squirrels were back when the Baptists took down the water-slide.

 

The Episcopalians tried a much more unique path by setting out pans of whiskey around their church in an effort to kill the squirrels with alcohol poisoning.  They sadly learned how much damage a band of drunk squirrels can do.

 

But the Catholic church came up with a more creative strategy!  They baptized all the squirrels and made them members of the church.  Now they only see them at Christmas and Easter.

 

Not much was heard from the Jewish synagogue.  They took the first squirrel and circumcised him.  They haven’t seen a squirrel since.",Jokes,381,1685118803.0,0.96

Frank wanted to be remembered.,"A group of older veterans had all gotten together after not seeing one another for many years.  When they met up they all learned that one of their buddies had passed away right before the get together was scheduled and his wife showed up with his ashes and her husbands request for all the guys.  
  
She explained that her husband wanted them all to have some of his ashes but they were to find a German style tankard and place his ashes inside of it and place that in somewhere of prominence in their home.    
  
All of them remembering their buddy Frank found the request odd but figured if that was what he wanted they would go along with it.  Frank was always a jokester when they knew him and figured there was a punch line to it all but none of them could figure it out.    
  
Over the next few years the veterans kept meeting up and discussing why in the world Frank wanted to be placed in some old tankard but nobody could quite figure out what the deal was.  Most of them were of the feeling that Frank wanted to do something so that they would get together more often and giving them an odd request was simply a way to accomplish that.  Eventually one of them was sitting at home when one of their grandchildren came over to visit and as usual he starts telling his grandson about the different things that he had seen in his life.  His grandson then starts asking about stuff that was on the mantle over the fireplace and the subject of Frank came up.

Hello, all. During the month of May, the sub book club will be reading **Daughter of the Moon Goddess** by Sue Lynn Tan! Each week, there will be a discussion thread and when we are done, Sue herself will be joining us for an AMA. Do please note that novel is classified as Young Adult.

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57789637-daughter-of-the-moon-goddess) (feel free to skip if you prefer to know nothing going into the book as the description contains minor spoilers):

>Growing up on the moon, Xingyin is accustomed to solitude, unaware that she is being hidden from the feared Celestial Emperor who exiled her mother for stealing his elixir of immortality. But when Xingyin’s magic flares and her existence is discovered, she is forced to flee her home, leaving her mother behind.  
>  
>Alone, powerless, and afraid, she makes her way to the Celestial Kingdom, a land of wonder and secrets. Disguising her identity, she seizes an opportunity to learn alongside the emperor's son, mastering archery and magic, even as passion flames between her and the prince.  
>  
>To save her mother, Xingyin embarks on a perilous quest, confronting legendary creatures and vicious enemies across the earth and skies. But when treachery looms and forbidden magic threatens the kingdom, she must challenge the ruthless Celestial Emperor for her dream—striking a dangerous bargain in which she is torn between losing all she loves or plunging the realm into chaos.

How many of you have partners or spouses that don't read?,"I'm an avid reader. Always have been. My wife? She might read a book a year. I'm on #6 for 2023. 

As an English teacher, being with her has been such an insight into why people might not read so consistently. It's showed me that, on one end, reading, especially novels, is very much a hobby like any other. But it's also shown me that reading is an activity and a pleasure that is very much cultivated by guardians or parents in childhood. Might seem like an obvious truth, but as the old saying goes, many obvious truths hide in plain sight. 

If anything, these realizations have made me a little more empathetic to those who don't read. I think there is a tendency in the book community to be a little pretentious when it comes to reading and what kind of people do and don't. 

Anyway, curious to see what the experience of others is here!",books,21,1685445127.0,0.79
Johnny Got His Gun by Dalton Trumbo,"Johnny Got His Gun is a war story, an atypical anti-war novel about the result of a young man going off to war in 1918.  It is unflinching and devastating. 

Taking place within the mind of our narrator Joe Bonham we get flashbacks to his pre war self, brief glimpses at combat, and most of all we get the stream-of-consciousness thoughts of a man trapped inside a prison that war created.  

It’s a moving novel that will leave you thinking long after you finish it.  It will make you reconsider notions such as liberty, freedom, decency, patriotism, and democracy.  It’s a powerful novel that does one of the most powerful things a novel can do.  It makes you re-examine your beliefs.",books,90,1685409425.0,0.96
'Jane Eyre' By Charlotte Brontë,"I just finished reading it & I'm kinda sad that there isn't more. But that just goes to show how great of a book it is. For those who don't know, 'Jane Eyre' is about a girl named Jane, she becomes an orphan when she is still a baby & her uncle & his family take care of her. Well, her uncle dies and she is left to be raised by her aunt that never cared for her & her three nasty children. In the book the reader witnesses Jane transform; she becomes someone who sticks up for herself, and doesn't hide their opinions, which was weird for a woman back then. I just love her, she's tiny but mighty, & an icon in my eyes. Plus I adore Mr. Rochester, every line he speaks makes me smile or laugh, he's quite a character. Anyway, I felt I had to write about it because it still lingers within me, if you haven't read it I highly recommend it! ♡",books,41,1685418222.0,0.88

Book/Library Tracking?,"Hey everyone!

I'm curious how folks around here are tracking their personal libraries - if they are at all. My wife and I have just over 680 physical books in just about every room of our house and for the past 10 years I've tracked them all in a spreadsheet that's gotten more and more detailed. I'm no data scientist or even all that great at excel, but man do I love my books. Below are some screenshots and details about the tracker, but I've always thought there must be a better way!

* [Main Library Page](https://imgur.com/WXEnryK) \- columns from left to right
   * Read - have I read the book?
   * Date - what year did I read it.
   * Author
   * Title
   * Published year
   * Genre
   * Sub-Genre
   * Series
   * Notes - Primarily used to track 1st editions and signed 1st editions
   * Type - Hard cover, Paperback, Mass Market, or Audio
   * Read - separate column for my wife
   * Author sex - may cause some contention but I was curious about the ratios
   * I also have it built out so the row that is currently selected is highlighted in green.
* [Statistics page](https://imgur.com/KZouyKr)
   * Total number of books read by genre and by person, as well as a running total of all books by genre.
   * Format - Total number of books in each print style.
      * Boy do we love hardbacks!
   * *Rough* price estimates - Hardcover at $24.99, Mass market at $7.99, and Trade at $14.99
      * Not really accurate on our spending as we buy used a lot and I was a bookseller with a large discount for many years.
   * Edition - 1st edition, signed 1st edition, and ARCs
   * Author gender
      * Really gotta up our game here
   * Percent of library read by both of us collectively
      * Woo at 77%!
   * Books in a series vs stand alone
      * We read a lot of fantasy
   * Published year
      * Primarily 1990+
   * Unread - sorted by genre and split up for both of us.
* [Graphs and Charts](https://imgur.com/1EPByj7)
   * Visual overview of some of the statistics on the previous page
* [Books that have won both the Hugo and the Nebula](https://imgur.com/sYRFmpe)
   * This is just a list of books that have won both the Hugo and the Nebula awards for Best Novel - while I think both awards are great independently they tend to be biased on their own so I figured the ones that won both have a little more merit.
   * I would like to track other award winners, but I'm embarrassed to say we probably don't have too many beyond the random Pulitzer here and there.

Before someone asks, we both use **Goodreads**\*,\* but to track *all* the books we read which is quite a bit more since we're avid library users.

What are you guys using to track your books? Are you tracking or am I crazy? What other statistics or information can I add that might be missing? (**Note**: it is too much of a pain in the ass to try and do page count and there is not a reliable source for word count that I can find).

I'm also happy to share the actual spreadsheet for others to use (unless that isn't allowed?).

"Books “Liberated from Religion” and “Wasting Time on God”, by Paulo Bitencourt","I was raised Evangelical. I am 21 years old. Some months ago, I started having doubts and questions about Bible, religion, church and God. I was depressed, because I couldn't believe anymore, but at the same time I was afraid of going to Hell (I know it sounds contradictory), and also of hurting my parents and relatives. Then I came across these two books. Oh, boy! They literally saved me! They made me understand that the imposition of fear is the very reason why one should reject religion in the first place. I feel much better now being a nonbeliever, and I even can justify with solid arguments my reasons for no longer believing.

Anyone here struggling with their belief in God, in any way feeling oppressed by religion? If you are a nonbeliever, was it easy for you to leave the church?",books,40,1685391372.0,0.71
What do you like about Crime/Thriller novels?,"So, I'm a big sci-fi buff, and I've never really dipped my toe into anything else, but like fantasy or romance. I just scare easily and I'm not good with reading something knowing that there's something lurking in the coming pages - I don't know if that makes sense.

Love in the Big City by Sang Young Park Timeline,"Has anyone made a timeline or could help me understand the timeline for all the events that occur in  Love in the Big City by Sang Young Park? There are a lot of clues in the text to get an idea of it but I was wondering if someone has compiled one yet or if there is an unofficial consensus on the order of events. I am on Part four of the book, and I am really enjoying it so far - however, I feel like I might get a better idea of the emotions being conveyed and the story overall if I was aware of how the different parts connected to each other.",books,3,1685433280.0,1.0

Silence by Shuzaku Endo,"This, to me, is such a heart-wrenching novel that kept me anxious for days. The book so vividly describes the travails of nascent Christianity in the Tokugawa Shogunate (note: I'm a lapsed Christian), and not only does it explore the theme of religious martyrdom and its existential underpinnings, but it also attempts to elucidate the idiosyncratic Japanese mindset that prevents itself from succumbing to the allures of an alien faith and culture.

"The Reader, by Bernhard Schlink","One of the best books I've ever read in my 60+ years of reading. Raises nuanced questions about issues that are often over-simplified, or about which we've collectively come to facile conclusions, and avoids pedantry or spoon-feeding the reader easy answers. Helps us to see familiar stories with fresh eyes, which is a miraculous gift for a writer to possess. 

I find it difficult to offer thoughts about the story, characters, or themes without tipping the author's hand, so I apologize for the vagueness of this post. It's best to come to the book knowing little about the story or issues in it. A reviewer who can review it more specifically without giving something pivotal away is a more adept writer than I am.

But even if you're coming to it after having seen the excellent film, the book will pack its own muscular punch. I don't know enough German to say how well the translation cleaves to the original. But as a reading experience, it is flawless, flowing, not showy, and impactful. 

Assuming this post results in any discussion amongst other readers (sorry: the pun is unavoidable), those who have not yet read the book should assume that there will be spoilers below. I would recommend reading the book before reading any discussion here.",books,15,1685394102.0,0.8
Earthlings by Sayaka Murata - what do you think of the ending/what do you think happens after?,"so obviously the ending was rather fever-dream-esque, and it's hard to know what was really happening, and what was all in natsuki's mind... but what do you think really happened? i've looked online to see if anyone has discussed it, but i can't find much about the very, very end.  
  
what do you reckon happens after the final moment? would they die from their injuries? like how were they not in pain? how were they walking towards the rescue group? 😭

Now is Not the Time to Panic,"I finished reading this book and it was so well written that I finished it in one evening.

I just finished “Coraline” by Neil Gaiman,"For those who haven’t read it, it is a brief and short novel about a young girl named Coraline. She finds a door in her house that is bricked off, and when she finds that door with the bricks mysteriously gone, she goes through to the other side. What she finds is an alternate version of her home, but one that is eerily perfect and has alternate copies of her parents that are too eager to have her stay there. Coraline leaves, but she finds that the other mother has kidnapped her real parents, so Coraline goes back into the alternate world to save them. 

I’ve read a few Neil Gaiman books now, but this is the first one that I’ve read that wasn’t targeted towards adults. It’s a little strange how his writing didn’t feel less mature; it instead felt similar to his other novels, but much more brief and skimping on details he would have otherwise included. It’s also baffling that he wrote this at the same time as *American Gods* (which I’m in the middle of as well), because that and *Coraline* couldn’t be further apart in tone and content. I really enjoyed this book, and I’d recommend it to those who are interested in it with the caveat that it is aimed at younger audiences.

I have some thoughts regarding it, and Neil’s writing in general:
- *Coraline* feels very similar to *The Ocean at the End of the Lane.* They both share a quality that I can’t quite put my finger on, but it’s almost like *The Ocean at the End of the Lane* was written to be a similar story for adult audiences. One to read when you’re young, the other to read when you’re reminiscing on being young.
- I have a tendency to envision (male) talking animals to sound like Keith David, so when I found out the cat was voiced by Keith David in the movie adaptation, I actually laughed. 10/10 casting. 
- Much like *The Hobbit,* I wish I actually read this as a child. That being said, I can’t wait to give either this book or *The Hobbit* to my future children and experience that childhood wonder through them. 
- This is one of the few books that I’ve read in a single day. It’s a great detox book when you need a day to take a break from your other books/hobbies.",books,326,1685326077.0,0.95

"I've found that translated Japanese Light novels are often repetitive and verbose. Is this a language or translation thing, or just poor writing?","In reincarnated as a slime, there's this one point in volume 17 I think, where the narrator implies something, the character explicitly states what the narrator just implied, and then the narrator literally repeats exactly what the character just said. It's mind boggling. 

That's the worst offender, but in many Japanese light novels, Isekai specifically, things great repeated a lot. Implied once, then clarified right after, repeated by character then narrator, etc. What's going on? Is this just bad writing, or does it relate to language and translation?

Typographical errors in books,"How many typographical errors do you usually come across in printed books? 

To the best of my recollection I don't usually find many at all, maybe one if unlucky, but I am reading a Simon and Schuster print of Fahrenheit 451 and am frankly disappointed there are two glaring editing mistakes - one being 'a' instead of 'as', and 'fight' instead of 'flight'. These are definitely errors given the context.

There's one more which I can let slide but still is printed differently in other editions - the word usually appears as 'unease' but in this version is printed as 'dis-ease'... like i said, I'll let that go because it could be forgiven as creative wordplay, the opposite of 'ease' being made by adding prefix 'dis-' whilst also conjuring up a feeling of being diseased.

In any case I'm surprised an established publisher has dropped the ball on such a classic text. I would've thought proofreading before final publishing is required for all texts.",books,3,1685410084.0,0.64
"People who read the same book annually/Bi annually, why?","I (34F) personally read Dracula once a year and have done now since I was 17. My friend (who isn't someone who enjoys reading) noticed I was reading Dracula once again and was absolutely baffled at the idea of re reading books. She understood the idea of it being my favourite book but couldnt see the point after 2nd maybe 3rd time as you know the story fully. I tried to explain that its more  that just my favourite story but that I almost use it as a measuring stick for personal growth year to year. 
I find this book to be so layered and complex that each year I come away having noticed something I hadn't before  or taken a different interpretation of certain symbolism. In the early years it was ever things as simple as learning new vocabulary.

What makes you decide to listen to an audiobook versus reading the book?,"I have recently rediscovered my love of reading and have been doing so with the written word. I’ve listened to a very few non-fiction audiobooks, but I’ve heard such great things about some fiction audio, that I’m interested in expanding into fiction audiobooks. My struggle is that I really love reading the written word, so I don’t know how to decide whether I read a book or listen to it.

How do you decide to listen to an audiobook versus reading it with your eyes?  What goes into your decision-making process, if anything?

"What do you think about people who annotate their books, breaks their spine, mark the pages ecc…?","I think this is a very controversial topic. I’m one of those people who likes to live their books. I don’t annotate them, unless it’s something I’m studying, but I bring the book I’m reading everywhere with me and it looks “used” once I’m done. I still take care of them , I don’t let them get wet, dirty, I don’t bend the cover but I love the look of used books, it means they are loved and they were lived. If it’s something I have to study (I study literature) I do annotate it heavily because this is the best method for me to understand it and I still love the finished looks.

I’ve never met someone like me, everyone I met is disgusted by the way I treat book, many people I know don’t even annotate textbook but leave them immaculate. It’s like they think it’s a sin, but in my opinion books are “things”, things are made to be used and it’s nice if you can se the passing of time on them, of course given that you take care of them and use them for what they are meant to be used.",books,0,1685441275.0,0.35

So I just read Song of Achilles for the first time,"I know, I'm like super late to it. I always meant to read it but my tbr list has been incredibly long for multiple years now.

Anyways, about the actual book. I am INCREDIBLY unwell. Like, I've been processing it for about 12 hours now and the sad feeling in my chest keeps getting worse as more time passes. I knew Greek mythology so I knew how it would end, but oh my god it hurt so much more than I thought it would. Seeing the relationship between Patroclus and Achilles evolve over however many years they knew each other was absolutely incredible and the ending successfully ripped my heart right out of my chest. The worst part for me was how Patroclus was kept from the underworld and separated from Achilles for so long. I can't even begin to imagine how painful that situation could be. As gut wrenching as it was, though, it's seriously one of my favorite books that I've ever read. Their entire story was perfect imo. All the tender, passionate moments as well as the few times they fought or disagreed over an issue. I don't normally cry because of books or movies, but I was basically sobbing while reading the last couple chapters. I honestly think this book has completely changed my brain chemistry and I am in love with it. I probably won't ever fully emotionally recover, but honestly I don't think I want to. 

Overall I think Madeline Miller did an amazing job at telling the beautiful story of Achilles and Patroclus. I would love to share these thoughts with someone I know in real life but sadly my one friend who's actually read it does not like Miller's writing style so she didn't really the book.",books,21,1685333117.0,0.71
"I regret reading ""An Arrow's Flight""","Don't get me wrong, it's a good book, very well written, and in some respect I think you're not supposed to \*like\* it. It's a story about the AIDS crisis, basically, but with characters from Greek Mythology (Achilles' son, Pyrrhus, is the protagonist).

Reading this book was like having a friend commiting suicide in front of you in slow motion. There are some scenes and passages that still haunt me around despite having finished reading the book a couple of weeks ago.

I have never regretted reading a book until now. I wish I could just erase it from my memory. And yet... despite the fantastical elements, this is something that happened to a lot of people. As a young queer that didn't live through this crisis, I'm glad I read it despite being so painful, I'm thankful that it allowed me to see and connect with that suffering.

Andromeda Strain by Michael Crichton,"After finishing Sphere, Andromeda Strain was highly recommended to me as my next Crichton read. I just finished it and…well, I was underwhelmed.

Like, things are moving along and scientists are underground dealing with a deadly organism from space only to have it mutate to eat rubber instead and hey everything is okay now!!<

The Secret History (and Donna Tartt) is kinda sus,"I’m a black male reading this book, and I was initially quite chill with the all white dark academia setting. In some way, I guess I still am, but the lack of awareness on the author’s part to cultural insensitivities or just chauvinistic approach to minorities just rubs me the wrong way. I felt like although slurs were given against Jews, the book has no real cultural awareness to the social inequities that produced such bigotry in the first place, using them as tools to only make a certain character look quirky… and the only mention of blackness, so far, has been to mention “diabolical rap”. It all just comes off as chauvinistic, which reflects on the author more than the characters in my opinion. Fun story, but just rubs me weirder the deeper I go.

Edit: I understand that characters can be written as assholes, I’m more interested in the context surrounding these assholes, and how it’s interpreted by the writer.",books,0,1685425287.0,0.38
Is reading an active or passive activity?,"I've been reading for a few years now and I have talked with lots of people about this and there seems to be different opinions on the topic.

For me, reading is a very active activity, I have to be mentally prepared and ready to catch all the information given by the author. Maybe its because I usually read 800-1000 pages epic fantasy which generally has lots of information and the world building is quite complex, but in my experience reading is not something I can do at any time of the day. In addition to this, I'm usually not able to read more than 1h straight because I literally get so tired from it. I don't understand how some people can read for +5 hours without a pause.

What I've been able to recollect from others opinions is that for them reading is something to disconnect, something that they can do when they are tired and not having to think too much. For me it's quite the contraty.

Just Finished Parable of The Talents by Octavia Butler and just wanna talk about it,"Trigger Warning: SA 

This book was SO good. Probably one of the rare times I prefer the sequel to tue first book. Firstly (and big old spoiler warning) Fuck Uncle Marc. All my homes hate Uncle Marc. What a conniving, back stabbing little piece of shit he turned out to be. Maybe it's because I have a young kid but I was so SO angry that he kept her child from her and all for himself because he couldn't admit the people he was with were a bunch of animals. What a self righteous piece if shit. ""I guess I just wasn't ready to share you with anyone"". I hope he suffers. I wish bad and painful things on him. The author absolutely NAILS Zealots as a group of monsters who see themselves as good people akd it makes me furious and scared at tue same time. I truly loved how introducing her daughter as someone READING the journal were given a more objective view of the main character. And I sort of agree with her daughter, Olaminas main goal should've always been to go after her daughter and Olamina IS a manipulator who uses her super empathy to better get inside people's heads. In an interesting way, the MC doesn't see anything wrong with what's she's doing. And I guess she never uses this power for evil but she is absolutely using it to control and enthrall people. She's dangerous. In an interesting way, I don't think she ever sees anything of her own absolute faith that she's doing the right thing (cause it's for the destiny) reflected back at her by her Christian captors, or even Marc. The ending was bittersweet, but overall hopeful which was nice! Overall 9/10, it's worth it to read the first one just to get to the second one.

Quick edit to say that I also loved how she never used the word Teacher for her captors, always ""Teacher"" with quotes. Like she never gives them the satisfaction of the title.",books,45,1685311857.0,0.87
Artemis by Andy Weir.,"Another astounding space sci-fi thriller by Weir. Surprising that this hasn’t been made into a movie because this is what an action/comedy/thriller space sci-fi needs. This book keeps you hooked for the most part. Why most parts? Well because some parts are just Jasmine “Jazz” Bashara the protagonist prolonging a normal convo. It’s not bad though just my opinion. Really liked how Weir portrays her; a woman who is happy go lucky and doesn’t give a fuck about almost anything and also funny.

This book does contain many space/moon tech technicalities which you have to reread to grasp it. Like “The Martian” (another must read by Weir) this books deals with the cruciality of time. I think this book’s climax could be made into like an Ocean’s Eleven kind of movie replacing the casino scenes with >!Jazz and her team trying to destroy the Sanchez Aluminum.!<

Why do people want to read fast?,"I was just thinking the other day that my wpm is average, sometimes below average. If I do want to try and read fast I can get to 308 wpm. But there’s people out here who read naturally or strive to read at like 300-400 wpm which is too fast for me. 

Like, I read in a way where the rhythm of the book is important to me. I purposefully read sometimes below average because I want to- need to add a certain tone or cadence to something in order for the book to make an impact on me. 

For fast readers, I just want to know why you read fast? Are you able to get the same results out of a book when you don’t take longer to think about tone or rhythm? Or are you able to still do that? Is it just about training your mind?

Poirot prevented Caroline from attending the final gathering of suspects, and he offered Dr Sheppard the option to take his own life, which Sheppard says will ensure that Caroline does not find out the truth. 

But presumably Poirot will tell the other suspects (Ackroyd's household) who the real killer was, or they will figure it out by process of elimination when they see that none of them is accused.

How open minded are you when you start reading a book? Are you aware of particular expectations?,"I sometimes try to avoid reading books that have been reviewed exceptionally well or have the ""classic"" designation. It's partly because I become very impatient with these books.

Maybe it started in high school where I was forced to read various books that were considered classics but which I hated. So maybe even as an adult, those memories are shaping my choices. 

It's like a meal that somebody says is the best they've ever had. Or a restaurant they say is among the best. So you go in there and right away think the waiter is taking too long to come to your table, or a particular appetizer does not taste so good, or maybe the prices are way too high. In short, you are quick to feel disappointed.

Of course, I don't want to pick a random book either, because there are like, what, over a million books published every year (just guessing), and I don't want to waste time reading something that is not well-written or is not about a topic that interests me at all.

So what I do is sort of go somewhere in the middle, pick a book that got some positive reviews, and I read to make sure it is a topic of potential interest, then I start reading.

Anyhow, I totally feel like my expectations are ruining my reading experience. I envy people who are so open minded and read widely and give books a chance. I really wish I could one day be like that.",books,13,1685318681.0,0.68

Vividness of The Wind-up Bird Chronicle,"I had just completed The wind-up bird chronicle. I enjoyed thoroughly but it left me with some questions. Lets discuss this things, if you've read it already.

1. 
What's with the chapters ""A boy in the night"", who've seen two men doing shaddy bussiness in the garden.
A. I mean who is that little boy... is it Cinnamon ?
B. What's that thing those two men hid in the ground ? And what does it signifies ?

2. 
What's with Nutmeg and for short period of time Toru as well, curing the women whoes in between thirties and fifties ?

3.
What are they (Nutmeg, Cinnamon and Toru) trying to built at vacant house ? Is it just passing some time till Toru really finds his way to go otherside of well ?

4.
Whats the significance of the men who has mark on right cheek and they are the only who can hears the cries of wind-up bird ?
A. Whats does it mean, when it appeared and disappeared on Toru's cheek ?

5. 
What is the wind-up bird anyway ? I have my view for this as well, but would really like to have some other perspective.
A. What's the connection of different character with it ?

6. 
Cinnamon's connection with ending.

7.
What is the deeper symbolism and interpretation of the well and the ""place beyond the well""?

"Has anyone ever successfully trained themselves out of *constantly*, no matter how much they're enjoying the book they're reading, hurrying through the end of a book so that you can get onto the next thing on your reading list?","I read everyday, but since my late teens/early 20s (I'm in my early 30s now) I've almost always, to some extent, 'powered through' the second half of books in order to get to either a) the next one I know I want to read or b) the opportunity to choose from the vast selection of new books that will interest and the backlog of books I mean to read at some point. 

I've theories as to why this is:

\- the awareness, as we get older, that time is limited. 

\- a greater awareness of the endless books and topics out there I'd like to read.

\- less time to read as an adult with adult responsibilites, thus less patience with texts. 

\- Goodreads's 'Reading Goal', something I've used for about a decade out of habit, but not something I feel too consciously beholden too now (in my mid-20s I do remember keeping an eye on it and planning reading accordingly in November and December).

Has anyone else found some of the examples used to defend the oh so prevalent ""default to truth"" theory a little thin? Specifically when talking about transparency and ""The Friends Fallacy"". I do get his point at large but also, couldn't the judge that let the potential murder (man who's gun jammed when trying to shoot his ex girlfriend) not just be that he naively bought a ""remorse"" narrative from defendant's facial expressions, but all sorts of rationalizations rooted in sexism (a women's life not as important as a man's) that could be occurring even subconsciously in that judge's mind. I find it hard to believe also that judges, after decades of experience, could fall so easily for a ""sad, remorseful"" face. I find the examples to be sort of brushing over the inherent sexism that could be at play.

Why do modern fantasy books (for adults) all contain romance?,"I used to love fantasy books as a kid, but when I became a teen all the books at my reading level started to become filled with romance. I mean books that on the blurb mention a fantasy story, when in reality the plot is replaced by romantic pursuits halfway through..

It's probably why after a while I switched to sci fi, which seemed to have less of this problem, but I just got bored of it eventually.

"Ridiculous vocabulary in The Netanyahus, by Joshua Cohen","I just finished reading this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.

This post isn't really about the book in general, but about its vocabulary. I've noticed this same issue in many books I've read, where it feels as though the writer is trying to make a point by using really obscure words, but that point is completely lost on me.

In this case, the story is in first-person, so are we supposed to assume that the narrator is ... stuffy? Learned? Intellectual? Showy?

It's really not clear, because aside from those crazy words, he's not really any of those things. He's a professor of history at a middling university, but in his conversations, he seems like a normal, slightly self-effacing guy. He sort of calls out another character for using words like peripety and climacteric.

But then, the narrative leaves that behind, and hits us with tons of words just like that.

So what's the point? Maybe we're just supposed to think that the author is smart?

I contrast this to books like Lolita, or The Debt to Pleasure (both of which I loved) where the high vocabulary and style is perfectly suited to, and complements, the character that we're learning about.

Here are some of the words I mean:

Cathexes, strappado, carceral, horripilation, pentimento, sudorific, pelage, pontonier \[EDIT: It was actually ""ponton"" as in: the car was ponton\], capirote, hyemal,  lucubration...

And then there were some that I knew (or kinda knew), but still classify them as difficult words: caudillo, nugatory, gloriole.

Lastly, he used some words in a weird way, so that I looked them up just to see if there was a definition that I was missing. Unfortunately, though I remember one was ""menial,"" I can't remember the context.

Anyone else read this book and felt the way I feel?

"if its fiction, i think names should really be translated","I am a non native english speaker. Ive read books translated from 3 languages i speak well enough to get cultural ques from, Turkish, Arabic, and Japanese translated into english (didnt go to school till i moved to the US in my teens, so english is my best/basically only reading language), and i have never once seen a name translated. Every language has cultural connotations to names that most other languages also have but for different names, and most also have pun names. If you dont translate the names, you miss out on critical context. the english 'jhon smith' might equal 'mohamed ibn mohamed' depending on which arab country youre translating for. ive seen 'dick longson' a couple times in English books, while the japanese have constant name puns, like what would translate to 'normal man' for what are supposed to be generic dudes. A failure to translate these names ruins the books for people who dont get the cultural context, because often the author will leave out information on the assumption the reader is getting the context. If a sneaky character introduces themselves as 'jhon smith' most English readers would assume its a fake name, but a foreign reader would assume otherwise until told differently (i did that), and its the same thing is happening when you read foreign books translated into english. It really annoys me and dissuades me from reading any books in languages im not already passingly familiar with because i know they arent going to translate everything i need to appreciate the book and it feels like im going to have to do chores to figure it out myself.",books,0,1685402221.0,0.2

I read all 190 Hardy Boys books,"See title, during the pandemic because I was bored and they're really easy to read. 

It took me about a year and a half, I think, mostly because I took a few long breaks when it started to get stale.

A few highlights: #1 The Tower Treasure, #3 The Secret Of The Old Mill,  and #11 While The Clock Ticked are probably my favorites out of the lot. Honorable mentions to #94 Breakdown In Axeblade and #99 Dungeon of Doom if only because they were *very* different.

The worst of the bunch was #59 Night of The Werewolf in my opinion, and that one still had some redeeming qualities but it's where the quality started to take a dip. Most of the rest of the bad ones don't really stick out because they were more dull than anything.

I hate buddy reading with my friend and I don't know how to tell her (a mini rant),"I met my friend online a little over two years ago and we bonded over our love of books. She strictly only reads fantasy and smut. I like to read really anything and don't care too much for romance/smut. I like it but it's definitely not something I absolutely NEED to have in a book. Over these last few years, she has recommended me books that she likes that ended up just being really bad, poorly written fanfic type of books. I'm just not into that and that's totally fine that she is. She's gotten offended when I've said I didn't enjoy them or I just stopped reading them. I'm also realizing as I write this that we never read anything I'm interested in but like I said, she's strictly fantasy romance. 

Anyway, we started reading a big fantasy series recently and I love the series itself. I just don't really like reading it WITH her and I feel like shit for it. Here's why: 

- I think I just don't like the pressure of buddy reads. I don't like the pressure of slowing down or speeding up to be at the same point in the story with her.
- Spoilers actually ruin things for me whereas she doesn't care about spoilers and will kinda taunt me with what she knows.. idk I just think it's kind of weird?
- If she is ahead of me in the story, she will 100% spoil what I haven't read yet.
- So there goes that pressure of having to speed up my reading so that I'm sure she won't spoil anything for me in the future 
- When I don't feel like reading for one day, she gets annoyed and again, pressures me into reading faster and it gets to the point where reading just isn't fun for me anymore 
- There's also big, interesting things happening in the books but she never talks about them with me. She only really focuses on the romance and spice and tension (which is like 5% in this series) and thinks the rest (95%) is boring so ????

I've told her many times to not spoil things for me. I've also told her how I don't read 300+ pages a day like it's a normal thing. Sometimes it's 100, sometimes it's 10.. i don't know... I've tried getting her into the main plot and she just doesn't care what I have to say which is fine if you're not into it but like why do I have to listen to you scream about the way this man looks at the girl??

I don't think buddy reads are for me. I like to read books on my own, at my own pace and when I'm finished, I like going online to discuss with other people. I thought that since we both liked the first series she introduced me to that this would be fun but it actually kinda sucks. I don't really know what else to tell her. I think she'd be very mad and hurt if I just suddenly said in the middle of this series that I don't want to read with her anymore. I don't know if I should tell her that I just don't want to read anymore (even though I love the series) or just finish it and probably never read with her again lol. What would YOU do? 

I'm also very aware of how small and stupid this ""problem"" is... kinda just wanted a place to rant lol so thanks if you read all the way through :)

TL;DR: I don't enjoy reading with my friend anymore, she spoils a lot for me, doesn't want to talk about the book, I feel pressured to read faster or slower to keep up with her, I don't know if I should tell her or keep going until it's done.",books,41,1685225537.0,0.79
I finished Sleepers by Lorenzo Carcaterra,"I get why this book was so contentious when it first came out now. 

Stylistically speaking, it has a lot of passages that read like a novel, not an autobiography. Like, nobody's remembering conversations where they were just shooting the breeze for a bit verbatim after thirty years. At other times, he's using the one-sentence paragraphs for extra impact, which tends to be more common in novels than in nonfiction. 

Of course, most of the controversy stems from how a lot of the details surrounding the court case have never been verified, despite the fact they should have been easily verifiable. A case where someone who used to be a guard at a juvenile detention centre gets murdered by two people who'd been detained there should have been big news; especially when he posthumously gets outed as a pedophile over the course of the trial. 

I feel like with a lot of the people who first started digging into it, what actually set them off was probably the writing style. So much of it just reads like a novel, and so much of Part III came off as something straight out of a revenge fantasy that it just seems a bit off. 

I really wanted to believe this story was true, too. Of course I think abuse happens in juvenile detention centres, and I think it's an issue that's probably massively underreported. But after almost thirty years, you'd expect for there to be a bit more than Lorenzo Carcaterra's say-so that his story is true; especially when a lot of it involved conspiracies and multiple victims.",books,9,1685248303.0,0.85
"I read ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" today and it was incredible!","Today I was going through a book fair and noticed a book of two F. Scott Fitzgerald short stories, ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and ""Head and Shoulders"". I was taken aback because I had heard of (but not seen) the film and did not know Fitzgerald was behind the story that inspired it. I read it in an hour while on the bus back home and actually was on the verge of tears by the time it was all over - not so much because it was a tragic story, but because of how how unbelievably human it all felt, and how human *it made me feel*.

It is one of those pieces of art that just captures our permanent struggle to understand the limited time we have here - and the even more limited time of our youths. Above all, and this may sound weird, it felt to me like a work that could only have ever been made by us, by our briefly-lived little species. It has so many themes that are expressed so subtly and beautifully (from the inevitability of age and death to the incapability of others to accept reality when faced with a break in normalcy) that I honestly think it summarises so many of my anxieties about life incredibly well. 

The progression of Button first hanging out with his grandfather (two old men, despite one having just been born), then with his father (people think they're brothers at one point), then with his grandson as a kid, and ending up all alone in kindergarten forgetting everything he ever did as the only kids who know him grow up normally and move to other grades, may be one of the most brutal things ever put to paper.",books,22,1685229213.0,0.78

"What are your favorites books that really speak to your senses? For example, they draw a vivid picture of a dance, describe food in mouth-watering details, or bring to life the sensations of those first touches of a budding romance?","I enjoy reading books that really speak to my senses. Partly because I'm kind of always in my head, so books that make me aware of sensations allow me to leave my head and go into my body and explore it a little more in terms of my bodily memories or sensations or desires.

One example is the book Chocolat by Joanne Harris, which I read after I saw the movie (with Binoche and Depp).

Here's a quote from the book, just to give you an idea of what I mean:

>In glass bells and dishes lie the chocolates, the pralines, Venus’s nipples, truffles, mendiants, candied fruits, hazelnut clusters, chocolate seashells, candied rose-petals, sugared violets . . .

A gingerbread house, walls of chocolate-coated pain d’épices with the detail piped on in silver and gold icing, roof tiles of florentines studded with crystallized fruits, strange vines of icing and chocolate growing up the walls, marzipan birds singing in chocolate trees . . .

Authorial whiplash from McCarthy to Sanderson,"Has anyone else experienced serious whiplash when moving from one author to another?

Earlier this week I finished Blood Meridian by McCarthy and as much as I enjoyed the book I felt I needed something lighter afterwards. Going through my to-read collection, I chose Oathbringer by Brandon Sanderson knowing it'd be lighter in tone and an easier read.

What I didn't expect was the shift between authors to be so impactful. It's almost unpleasant.

Prose between authors is an obvious difference. I struggled getting into Blood Meridian because of McCarthy's writing style. A lot of information is conveyed in very few words while artful descriptions paint the journey of the kid. Returning to Sanderson has been easy because his style is so direct and conventional. Sanderson takes his time to explore character feelings and remind readers of previous moments. What Sanderson spends three pages holding our hand through, McCarthy throws down with a single paragraph and expects us to clean it up.

I'm not saying either author has a better style of story telling. But jumping from one to the other makes apparent the different writing styles. I'm almost bored reading Oathbringer because it takes Sanderson so long to reach the point.

However, it's the approach to violence from both authors that's really affected me. 

McCarthy's depiction of violence is sickening. It's vivid, horrible, upsetting, unrelenting, and overwhelming at times. When the kid witnesses someone being clubbed in the head, the reader is going to experience what it's like to see someone being brained. Meanwhile Sanderson depicts violence as a morally bad, but an ultimately dismissible aspect of life for his characters. Early in Oathbringer one of Dalinar's chapters features him cutting his way through an army. Dalinar just slices and dices the enemy without a care. Soldiers are dying left and right but that's the extent of all we hear. He then wipes his sword of blood and quips to himself before carrying onto the next plot point.

Going from a brutal description of someone being maimed to a handwavey ""and he defeated the whole  army not wearing armour because he's so cool, you guys"" has really caught me off guard. It's almost like violence is trivialised now, whereas before it was reveled.

These novels are completely different. They have different levels of engagement aimed at vastly different audiences. But jumping from one to the other has really caused me to think about different writing approaches. We're not comparing apples and oranges; we're comparing apples and chicken nuggets.

I love the fact it's like Lord of the Rings if you remove a good 70% of the descriptions and throw in some Zorro-like shenanigans. It's 1st person, but it's one of the few I can stand, so he does it right.

I just finished a great book about one of my favorite art groups.,"Yesterday, I finished reading *The Pre-Raphaelite Language of Flowers* by Debra N. Mancoff, and I could not recommend it more. At only around 80 pages, and with half of those pages being paintings, it is a very quick read, but extremely rich in content. I've always been fascinated with symbolism in figurative art, and this book focuses on the meanings of flowers in the artwork of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, one of my favorite artistic associations ever.

One of the principles of the Brotherhood was to study nature so that it might be effectively represented in their artwork. The importance of nature is emphasized in paintings like 'Spring' by Millais and 'The Soul of the Rose' by Waterhouse. Throughout the book, Mancoff introduces readers to the Victorian and medieval symbolism associated with various flowers, from the heliotrope and sunflower to the rose and daisy. This use of flowers, combined with the characters, results in every piece of art effectively presenting a narrative. Even if the viewer is unaware of the exact narrative behind the painting, the sense of symbolism is obvious, and one can be assured that this is art that *means something.*

Another principle of the Brotherhood was the belief that art should have a level of spiritual integrity and heartfeltness. Mancoff's commentary in this book does a great job of introducing the reader to what these artworks meant to their creators and commissioners. Whether it is the sorrow of 'Broken Vows' by Calderon, the maternal patriotism of 'Queen Victoria With Prince Arthur' by Winterhalter, the aestheticism of 'Sunflowers and Hollyhocks' by Hayllor, or the real-life romances and scandals behind 'Ellen Terry' by Watts or the Portraits of Georgiana Burne-Jones and Mary Zambaco, by Edward Burne-Jones, this is more than just a showcase of pretty pictures, but a glimpse into the lives of some of the Victorian era's greatest artists.",books,15,1685212645.0,0.87

Have you found that your taste in audiobooks is different than your taste in books otherwise?,"I’ve always been and remain a very avid reader but for some reason, for all of my life, I’ve been resistant to audiobooks. I don’t know why and don’t think that it was snobbery, I had no problem with anyone else using audiobooks and never considered them to be a lesser kind of reading, but I had no interest until about 18 months ago. 

Also, although I read and love all sorts of books from all sorts of genres and authors as varied as Ovid and Heinrich Heine and Edith Wharton and Zadie Smith, science fiction — with a couple of exceptions like A Canticle for Leibowitz* and *Gravity’s Rainbow* which are atypical of the genre — is a genre that I’ve never been able to sit down and read, despite actually being interested in a lot of the concepts. I do like to listen to podcasts and lectures when I’m doing work or laying down so one day I tried to listen to Ursula K Le Guin’s *The Dispossessed* and I loved it, since then I’ve “read” most of Iain Banks’ *The Culture*, several books by Philip K Dick like *The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, VALIS, The Divine Invasion, The Transmigration of Timothy Archer* and *Radio Free Albemuth*, Octavia Butler’s *Xenogenesis* trilogy and I’ve just finished Kim Stanley Robinson’s *Red Mars* and am about to begin *Green Mars*.

What’s interesting is, I’ve purchased copies of most of these books, either to read along or to keep reading when I can’t listen to an audiobook for whatever reason, but I still find these books, which I really enjoy listening too, unpleasant or boring to read.

Annotating books - yes or no?,"I love the looks of it and honestly envy people who annotate their books but I just can’t do it.

"Finished The Stand, don't get the ending criticism","I feel like the ending was perfectly telegraphed through the rest of the novel. Maybe my expectations colored this because I've heard so much disappointment about how the ""final showdown"" happens but I feel like the entire last third of the book was the final showdown with Flagg recieving L after L until Trashy brought the A-Bomb. Wish Larry, Glenn and Ralph didn't have to die but I appreciated their sacrifice, and how confident and at peace theywvere at the end--especially Larry. Great character. Speaking of great characters...

Tom Cullen is amazing, I love him to death. That's all there.

Ultimately, I feel terrible about Harold. So much potential and I wish that there was a possibility that Harold in some other life could have a second chance. 

Really happy I finally got around to reading The Stand.

Sometimes grab books from the library and notice peculiarities that make me question things. Why does this book about counterinsurgency mention do much about the Greeks but never anything about Afghanistan, and why is he constantly mentioning the French in Vietnam and not the Americans. Look to the copyright date to discover it was written in 1964.

Similar things happened when I was reading a book about the CIA and the author mentioned how he remembered the boar war that happened in 1905. I didnt find out the Dave Grossmans on killing was written in the 90s till 3 years after I read it.

Please help me understand this quote in Before The Coffee Gets Cold.,"“Water flows from high places to low places. That is the nature of gravity. Emotions also seem to act according to gravity. When in the presence of someone with whom you have a bond, and to whom you have entrusted your feelings, it is hard to lie and get away with it. The truth just wants to come flowing out. This is especially the case when you are trying to hide your sadness or vulnerability. It is much easier to conceal sadness from a stranger, or from someone you don’t trust.”

"Do you like to imagine the main character as ""you""? Especially in first person voice","I was talking to a friend recently, who mentioned some books they read, and that they didn't like some of the books because the first-person narrator was too far from their own selves. It confused me for a bit -- of course a character would be different from you!

But they had assumed first-person was that way because it's meant to be ""you"", and you're supposed to project yourself.

I had assumed first person was like you listening to someone tell you a story, like when you're at a party and you hear a friend tell you about this wild thing that happened. 

I'm sure many stories exist on both ends of the spectrum, but I realized it's probably explains my negative feelings toward some recently first-person books I read: I viewed the main character as a total self-obsessed narcissist, but if it's meant to be \*you\*, then \*you\* are assumed to be justified in your actions, and that's part of the escapist fantasy.

There is literally nothing wrong with any style of reading, so this is not meant as a judgment -- just as a curiosity to see what's in your mind as you read. When you read a book, do you insert yourself into the narrative? I suppose a similar thing would be creating an avatar that looks like you in a video with a create-a-character, like The Sims or Skyrim.",books,104,1685106430.0,0.85

To anyone looking for a new whodunit rec: The Decagon House Murders,"Since whodunits are having a revival, I feel like a lot of the mystery recs on this sub have been pretty similar. For anyone who’s read a majority of the OG classics & modern day classics, it’s hard to find one that will actually surprise you in a satisfying way.

The Decagon House Murders by Yukito Ayatsuji is legitimately great - it’s originally Japanese written in the 80s but should be available most places with its English translation

The premise is VERY “And Then There Were None,” - the characters themselves talk about it in the book. It’s about a bunch of college kids who go on a trip to an island to stay at the Decagon house and start getting killed off one by one.

As a warning: the writing, especially in the beginning, is not that great. I’m not sure if it’s the translation but I think it’s just that it’s the author’s first novel and he wasn’t very good, technically. Choppy sentences, not great flow, extremely mediocre prose. I was actually close to DNFing it lmao because I thought the quality was so mediocre, BUT once it gets going it’s really impossible to put down. The plot is addicting and the atmosphere is tense despite the writing limitations.

The reveal is excellent - it’s that perfect “omg I should’ve seen it coming duh there were clues I noticed but didn’t put together” while simultaneously being shocking. The type where you go back and reread the reveal because you can’t believe it.

 It’s not completely airtight—there’s a little suspension of disbelief/“what would the villain have done if X thing happened” etc but overall I think it’s incredibly good and satisfying. 

Unfortunately Ayatsuji’s follow up Mill House Murders is the complete opposite: written well but boring/predictable/solvable in the first 20 pages lol. 

But anyway highly recommend Decagon for anyone who’s read all the popular mysteries and looking for something new!!",books,87,1685090223.0,0.94

So I thought ""Why not spend it reading?"". But I only get through about a quarter or half of a book before I grow bored of it and put it on the shelf.

The Wonder by Emma Donoghue,"A story set in the 1980s’ Ireland of an English nurse to take care of an Irish child or more.

This book really brought me out of my Reader’s block so kudos for that. It’s more of a psychological thriller with the elements of Christianity/Spiritualism entwined. Really loved the way how the Author has put the book together despite the climax was a bit of a meh to me. The book starts off slow and keeps you intrigued till the end. >!Will the child die or not?!< It kept me hooked that I finished it within two days (a big deal because of this long readers block I’ve been having). 

The tension between the English nurse and the Irish is another intriguing aspect of the book. Despite the English nurse (or nurses in general) who should be specialized in sympathy deters from it when it comes to the Irish people. The way she is apathetic towards the Irish and condescension towards their beliefs and virtues is wrote well that you as a reader feel furious at her prejudice towards them. The more you read the more her character develops but later onwards you  are more inclined to believe that her way of treatment towards them is right (Don’t wanna spoil why). 

This story is based on some real life incidents that took place in Ireland during that period where >!overtly religious people going into the delirium that they can survive without food for God’s sake.!<This isn’t like any other thrillers where you’d have twists that will make you gape your mouth but moreover like not twists but revelations of what happened/happens.

A Scanner Darkly by Philip K Dick is the best book I've read in a long time. The dialogue is outrageously entertaining and he manages to completely transport you into someone else's mind - which is an especially crazy feeling given that the main character is spiraling into drug-induced paranoia,"I finished reading it weeks ago, but it just keeps circling back around in my head. This is one of those books that I know will change the way I think for years to come, and gave me a new sense of empathy for what addiction feels like.

Here's the setup (no spoilers, in tags just in case you like to go in totally blank slate):

>!Substance D is a new drug sweeping the nation and slowly destroying the minds of its users. As the connection between the two halves of their brains degrades, they grow increasingly disoriented and confused before suffering irreversible brain damage.!<

>!Fred is an undercover narcotics agent working to uncover where the new drug is coming from. But to find the source he has to pose as Bob Arctor, a user, and soon Arctor is as addicted as the junkies around him. Can he see through his paranoia long enough to tell which leads are real and which imagined? Or will he be consumed, like his friends, by substance D?!<

Despite the gritty, near-future setting and the serious themes, the book is funny pretty frequently because **the dialogue is so good**. Our characters may be drugs addicts spiraling into addiction, but that doesn't mean they don't act like normal friends ribbing each other and cracking jokes - at least when the times are good.

There is some very cool stuff here about **the theory of the mind and brain physiology/biology**. and even better, those facts perfectly set the stage for the twist halfway through the book so that it feels surprising but also totally in keeping with those (real) brain facts that were dropped along the way.

A big part of the reason the book feels so real is probably because it is real - Dick has said all the books he wrote before 1970 he wrote on amphetamines, and **Scanner Darkly was written as a reflection of his time as an addict**, and was the first book he wrote sober. He dedicates the book in an afterword to his friends who died or suffered irreversible brain damage from drug use - and the list is way too long. It hit so hard it made me tear up (literally, not figuratively).

If you want one of those rare books that helps you see the world through someone else's eyes (while being wildly entertaining at the same time), this is it!

"John Grisham's ""A Time for Mercy"" Theory","So the ending left me wanting...something.  I had a theory brewing through the back half of the book that was never confirmed nor denied: Brother Charles McGarry is the father of Keira's baby.  
Evidence:  
\#1: The mere presence of the McGarrys (and specifically young Charles) is an obvious Chekhov's gun.  There is no real reason for him to keep popping up in the story, and the fact that he has a healthy baby boy with his wife is a reminder to the reader that this guy... gets after it.  
\#2: Brother Charles making house calls, especially with no one home besides Keira, is... odd.  Grisham clearly has no qualms about showing the ugly underbelly of American institutions (the court system, law enforcement), so why should the clergy be any different?  Brother Charles is new, doesn't know what he's doing, has a pregnant wife and is human... it might not have been force-able, but he tried to reach Keira on an intimate level and gave in to his human weakness.  
\#3 The time matches up.  If Brother Charles sowed his seed that late night in December, that lines up with Keira's due date, her knowledge of probably being pregnant the night Stu was killed, etc.  
\#4 Stu's idea to look at Keira seemed novel in the first chapter.  If this was a true first-parent perspective on his thought-process, it does not seem like the sort of thing he would think of as an afterthought.  The physical/verbal/emotional abuse was 100% happening... maybe the sexual abuse was embellished.  
\#5 Juror Carpenter calling out the ugliness we all know exists: Teenagers lie to get out of trouble.  Teenagers growing up in trauma are not 100% innocent.  
\#6 Stu was the perfect patsy.  He deserved everything he got for what he did to Josie and the family...but maybe the last straw to finally off him was to blame him for Keira's pregnancy, get Charles off the hook, and get him out of the Gambles' lives.  
No blood test, the adoption closed... not saying the Brigances knew anything, but it could be the byproduct of a cover-up initiated by the Gambles.",books,2,1685142828.0,0.67

I think I don't like reading anymore,"I used to read constantly. All the time. Always a book in my hand even for a trip to the gas station. Then I started my adult life and naturally had less time to read - a book or two a day became a book or two a week - and that was fine. I discovered fanfics and book reading went down, but I was still *reading* and through the years I went back and forth between published books and fics, and it was fine. 

I've been in a slump though. I don't mean a recent one, it's been ongoing. I stopped being interested in any traditionally published book, but I told myself that was okay because I was reading fics, and then I stopped reading fics, but that was okay because I liked audiobooks and that's really fine because even if it's listening, I'm still reading books. 

But now I can't get very far through an audiobook before I'm turning it off and sitting in silence. I get books from the library and read the first few chapters and then return them because I just can't be bothered anymore. 

It's not that the stories aren't interesting. It's not genre burnout because I've been switching it up both genre and reading level wise, including ones I usually avoid full stop, just to try. It's not that I need something new because I can't seem to care about it, and it's not that I need something loved and familiar because I tried that and didn't make it past chapter 1. 

I can't even blame my mental health. I'm in therapy and on meds and in a better place than I've been in years, and I've been in this good place for a while now so I can't even say it's an adjustment period. 

I used to *define* myself by my love of reading, and without it I feel adrift. I was so passionate about it and now I just feel nothing. It's like yeah, those are words on a page. They just don't ensnare me like they used to. Instead of being something I get lost in, they're still just words on a page. 

There are books that I've powered through, and a couple that I enjoyed more than this sort of midwave of bleh that's seems to have taken over the excitement I used to feel about reading, but even the books I finish are less of ""I love this and have to know what happens"" and more ""I mean, I made it this far, might as well finish I guess"" type things.

I don't want to be over reading, but I think I might be. Has anyone else experienced this? Have you recovered your love of reading? I've tried so many things and I just don't know what else to try.",books,0,1685182689.0,0.43
"The Pathless Path by Paul Millerd, Not the Traditional Path!","This is my note of a book called ""The Pathless Path"" by Paul Millerd. It was talked about by Ali Abdaal.

\- interesting quotes make us rethink the traditional path  
\- “The ease of having an ambition is that it can be explained to others; the very disease of ambition is that it can be so easily explained to others.” – David Whyte  
\- “With so many options it can be tempting to pick a path that offers certainty rather than doing the harder work of figuring out what we really want” – Paul Millerd  
\- “The desire for security and the feeling of insecurity are the same things” – Alan Watts, Zen Philosopher  
\- “Instead of thinking about what you want to do with your life, you default to the options most admired by your peers.” – Paul Millerd  
\- “The educated, hardworking masses are still doing what they’re told, but they’re no longer getting what they deserve.” – Seth Godin  
\- “Many people will override their own desires to meet the perceived expectations of others.” – Paul Millerd  
\- “For example, in Taipei, people in the previous generation were able to purchase property with only a couple of years of savings from an average job. Now Taipei is home to one of the highest price‑to‑rent ratios in the world, and this same goal can take more than twenty years and for many, it is simply impossible. While the economic situation has changed radically, many young people orient their lives towards this same goal.” – Paul Millerd  
\- Your intuition is wrong! 97% of people think “A person is successful if they have followed their interests and talents to become the best they can be at what they care about most.” according to research.  
\- Having previous impressive credentials can open doors, BUT it hasn’t translated into a high income for the author, especially, with some of the more creative things he’s done like writing or online courses.  
\- Targeting a mass audience is the traditional(default) path of thinking.  
\- Riding a ladder the pathless path means accepting that you might not know what you are doing and you might look like a fool.  
\- What to do  
\- Figure out what you have to offer. Ask a few close friends “When have you seen me at my best self?”  
\- Disconnect yourself from traditional work for a bit like 1 month.  
\- Be patient.

Does anyone feel unable to read a (somewhat) recent book by someone who killed themselves?,"Especially when said book is about problems that are pertinent to our living situation. 

The two that come to mind are Infinite Jest by DFW and Capitalist Realism by Mark Fisher. 

There's something about reading a book by someone who didn't make it that makes our predicament feel kind of... hopeless.

Like they had a diagnosis of a problem we face. Maybe even the start of a solution...

But there was no happy ending for them. 

Or, worse, acknowledging and confronting the problem just lead them no where in the end anyway.

So everything they wrote in the book feels kind of like a dead end. 

I know that's not the point and this isn't a great way to think about it, but I just can't bring myself to read them for this reason.

Reading r/books, I am surprised by the popularity of Umberto Eco's *The Name of The Rose*. Here, in Italy, it is notoriously known for being a difficult book. Not only, in the original version, it presents a good mix of Italian and Latin, but it also presents different reading levels: from a ""superficial"" historical mystery nevel, to a philosophical questioning over faith and rationality.

I think that the ability to write in totally different genres can be praiseworthy.

"Ellen Datlow's ""Body Shocks: Extreme Tales of Body Horror"".","Ellen Datlow has certainly become my favorite horror anthologist as just now I have finished another anthology by her ""Body Shocks: Extreme Tales of Body Horror"".

Of course the sub genre of body horror needs no introduction. With origins dating back all the way to Mary Shelly's ""Frankenstein"", body horror is essentially horror surrounding the human body. Fears of alterations, infestations, transformations, damage and decay of our meatsuits.

There are famous names associated with this subgenre from David Cronenberg and John Carpenter and writers like John W. Campbell with ""Who Goes There?"" (Which was adapted into two films under the title ""The Thing""), George Langelann's ""The Fly"", and Harlan Ellison's ""I Have no Mouth and I Must Scream"". And let's not forget that body horror is also big in Japan with manga writers like Junji Ito and Hitoshi Iwaaki and also films such as ""Tesuo: The Iron Man"" and ""Akira"".

Back to this anthology, this volume contains twenty nine stories from twenty nine authors. Many of them established authors with some having published stories in Datlow's ""Best Horror of the Year"" series"". Among the twenty nine authors I was pleasantly surprised to find that it included a story by R.C Matheson, son of the late Richard Matheson.

The stories in this anthology are gruesome as they are good. And some of these stories can very intense as well. Favorites from this anthology include ""The Traveller's Stay"" by Ray Cluley, ""Toother"" by Terry Dowling, ""You Go Where It Takes You"" by Nathan Ballingrud, ""A Positive"" by Kaaron Warren, Lucy Taylor's ""Subsumption"", Cody Goodfellow's ""Atwater"", ""Cuckoo"" by Angela Slatter, Tananarive Due's ""The Lake"", of course ""I'm Always Here"" by R.C Matheson, Senan MCguire's ""Spores"", Gemma Files's ""Skin City"", Tom Johnstone's ""What I Found in the Shed"", and ""Tissue Ablation and Variant regeneration: A Case Report"" by Michael Blumlein.

I think the title of “100 Years of Solitude” is a poor translation.,"The Spanish word, soledad, is translated as either “loneliness” or “solitude”. In English, solitude refers merely to the state of being alone, usually in a positive sense of finding calm. To my mind, none of the characters in the book are ever really in solitude, except for the one guy who hides in the jungle to avoid his curse. Loneliness, abandonment, or even “aloneness” seem like they would fit better. Especially with the final quote. Sure, “solitude” has a better ring to it, but it always bothered me after reading this book.

Crucial info (imo) about used book sellers/AbeBooks/Thriftbooks/the like,"Thriftbooks and Abebooks and all those used book resellers(Thriftbooks) and used book seller market places (AbeBooks) are INCREDIBLE, but my advice that I learned through experience is that if you’re sort of a stickler about the quality of the books/them not being written in/marked up/in rough shape like me, the lowest condition book you should buy is ‘Very Good’. Obviously only if you care about that.. I personally have a bit of an OCD thing about the physical quality of my books. Also there’s no shortage on ‘Very Good’ used copies.. it’s not rare to find books in that condition at all, yet you can still find books around 65% off in that condition. 

The books that are labeled 
Condition: ‘Poor’ ‘Acceptable’ and even ‘Good’ imo are often too damaged to be happy with. Again, this is my opinion. I’m sure there are ‘Good’s that are okay, but yeah.. I have bought many books in all conditions, this is my personal opinion/experience.

But with ‘Very Good’ and ‘Like New’ condition books, can get almost brand new looking books that are normally $20 for $5-6 dollars (the ‘Like News’ are a bit more expensive than that usually) why would you not? If you don’t buy books because they’re too expensive but want physically good quality books, I would utilize this advice. It’s good advice.

(Extra info) I personally go to Abebooks first because AbeBooks is a used book seller marketplace.. meaning they provide for you many different sellers who are selling the book you searched for, including all sorts of smaller book shops (small businesses/non corporate book shops). I’m fairly certain Thriftbooks is not a marketplace in this way, but sells the books they personally acquire. I personally will check Thriftbooks if Abebooks doesn’t have the book I’m looking for/the condition and price I’m looking for.

This is advice for people who wants books in the best possible condition for the lowest possible price!",books,0,1685077289.0,0.36
Satisfying redemption arc in literature,"What are some good redemption arcs in literature? I’m thinking of satisfying redemption arcs that show characters who are morally grey or evil in the beginning and then turn themselves into good people, because of their actions. I really like such a manga and anime series Rurouni Kenshin and there the main hero starts as a morally grey assassin and later becomes a positive hero who saves lives and at the end even gets a happy ending. I really like it, because it’s really rare to see a character who’s really consistent in their atonement.
On the other hand, I like the works by J. R. R. Tolkien who rarely wrote full redemption arcs. For example, his character of Maedhros who’s a morally grey character and who keeps atoning and not atoning for his actions. At the end, his redemption is left quite vague to the reader.",books,6,1685013262.0,0.76

"The Cruel Prince, by Holly Black - Here are my thoughts. What were yours?","I am pretty torn over this book.

On one hand, the first half I hated. I thought the plot had potential, I just strongly disliked the author's writing style. On the other hand, it had a kind of.. addictive quality to it. Especially into the second half, I found myself needing to know what happens next.

The author does include some folklore. And I appreciate that she actually took time to research and what is included is relatively accurate. Additionally, after a certain point I just found myself needing to know what happens next. I didn't care for Jude's love interests or the weird tournament she entered or her immature bullies and especially not for Cardan. But, without giving any spoilers, I felt things beginning to mature towards the end. It was more about fantasy politics opposed to an annoying MC being bullied by her classmates.

In the first few chapters, the main character's parents are murdered. And it's so boring. There is no emotion, there is nothing to make you empathise with Jude as she's witnessing this tragedy. It's not written like a tragedy at all, and that doesn't feel intentional. And this continues for a lot of the book, it just makes it pretty boring.

There's no proper set up for the world Jude finds herself in. In my opinion, a good book is one that is able to explain a world within the plot, in the first few chapters. For me, a good example of this is Shadow and Bone, this book sets up and explains the magical world very well, but without going out of its way to do it. That book incorporates this explanation into the plot, while The Cruel Prince doesn't. This book doesn't explain some key & reoccurring concepts until about halfway through. Black seems to just throw the world and its characters at the reader without much explanation or context, and expects us to go 'oh yeah that makes perfect sense'. In my opinion, even plot twists shouldn't be entirely out of the blue. This was one of my initial introductions to the fantasy genre, but I had read a lot of mystery. And in most of these books, the big reveal or realisation is a massive penny-drop moment - but you had enough clues and small details throughout that it makes sense. It makes you go 'Why didn't I see that coming?', whereas this book just makes you go '...what?'.

Also, I despised Cardan. I've seen so many comments and reviews saying they love him, but I hate him with a burning passion. I cannot stand the hot bully love interest, and Cardan is no exception. He treats Jude awfully the whole way through the book, and as soon as HE needs something, he starts treating her a little better but still like an entitled jerk. Abusive and problematic men being treated as the ultimate love interest is just gross to me. Now, I have since read the two sequels to the trilogy, and it gets a bit better - especially in The Queen of Nothing. And yes I know it's the whole character arc thing, but it's still gross.

And finally... there was very little substance. Until the last few chapters, I felt very little actually happened. A lot of a human girl being bullied, and that weird, boring tournament I completely forgot about until writing a review... but towards the end it did hugely improve. >!Spies, murder & plotting.!< More like fantasy politics. And I liked that.

Of course, this is just my personal opinion and I would love to hear others, no matter if you agree or disagree. At the end of the day, this book wasn't bad. I did somewhat enjoy it towards the end. And the two sequels were incredible in comparison. I genuinely loved The Queen of Nothing.",books,6,1685009033.0,0.75

"Conflicting Ideas in ""The War Of Art""","Just finished reading ""The War Of Art"" by Steven Pressfield and feel there are some confusing contradictions in it;

He talks about not getting stuck on a single thing, adapting along the path as needed.but also tells you to work on what comes ""through you"" and avoid producing what the market or people want, to not satisfy anyone but yourself.

He speaks of beeing a vessel for the work, giving it life like a mother to her child, not deciding how it comes out. Don't let the critiques effect how you do things. But at the same time expects you to be objective about your work, change what needs changing and improve what's good, while exposing yourself and taking criticism.

Working for the love of it and money's another confusing subject;Do it for the money because you love working on it - While at the same time don't do what you need in order to satisfy people's hunger (which is doing it for the money and adapting yourself)

Weird sentence in Hannibal (1999) Thomas Harris,"“*She wanted to go inside. She wanted to go in, wanting it as we want to jump from balconies, as the glint of the rails tempts us when we hear the approaching train*.”

What’s going on with this sentence? This comes at the point in the book where Starling revisits the Baltimore State Hospital and has to go back down to the basement.  

I think these are two different suicide references but they come together in a way that makes no sense to me. The first is jumping off the rail of (specifically) a balcony.  The second, standing on the rails of a train track.  

I’ve read this twenty times now and my wife doesn’t get it either.  Did Harris make a mistake?  Was he trying to decide which method of suicide to reference and got hung up on the word “rail”?  Or is there a way to read this that I’m not seeing?

Murtagh comes out in November! And we're getting a Disney+ tv series!,"With Murtagh coming out in November that is set a year after the events of the fourth book, it feels inherent that I recommend the Inheritance Cycle to everyone! Because reading that won't make much sense if you don't read the original four books first! 

If you like fantasy, may I please suggest the Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini! 

I read this series at least once a year, I'm reading it rn actually.  It makes me believe that even the smallest person can make change and that nothing is impossible if you have control of your own mind. 

The books are well thought out, well written, the world building, language building and lore are amazing, like up there with Tolkien in terms of that and Ursala K. Guin and all the fantasy greats. And the first book was written when the author was 15. Which is an outstanding achievement. 

The depth to each character. The sheer amount of character building. The in depth and truly clever descriptions of everything, even the most seemingly mundane things that he harkens back to chapters later. The complex language creation. *Multiple* languages! Complex poems and songs. Complex politics and strategy. Simultaneous story telling of multiple characters that flows seamlessly together and doesn't feel misplaced or clunky when we switch to a new chapter about a different character. These are just some of the reasons why I love these books.
 
This series is, and will forevermore remain, one of the most gripping, sensational, deep, profound reads of my life. 

And I read a lot. I'm a podcaster and journalist who does all their own research when I'm not cheffing it up. I literally read at least one book a week, usually more, and am always reading multiple books simultaneously. 

These books *changed* me. Like really changed me. They made me question things and search out different answers than I was provided in my racist small town. These books are a pivotal part of why I became the person I am today by driving me to leave that little town that I never thought I was going to leave other than for college. 

I first read Eragon when it came out 20 years ago. I was nine (I was already reading at a college level and my parents didn't pre read the book to see how dark parts of it were 😂.) I devoured it, literally read it in 2 days. I just checked my copy, it's 528 pages. I eagerly and desperately awaited the second book and in kind, the third book. It was originally supposed to be a trilogy but thanks to Paolini's intense world building and absolutely exceptional story, he ended up writing four books for the story. When this was announced, I was in high school, and the school librarian who was also the advisor for the school paper that I was editor in chief of, told me because I definitely did not see the press release at 16. I was so excited that we were getting even more expansion to the story and Alagaesia. The fourth book came out my first year of culinary school and i literally skipped a day and a half of classes to read it. I laughed out loud, I cried multiple times, I gasped with shock and delight and I could not stop turning the page when I read these books. These books STILL make me laugh and cry and feel a whole breadth of emotions. 

This is one of the most eloquent adventures for the mind and soul that exists in written media. And it is criminally underrated.

Not only did Paolini write 4 *thick ass* main books for the series, he wrote an accompanying book of world lore for Alagaesia. There is a fifth book coming out this November along with an illustrated Eragon that has apparently like 50 illustrations of the story and the world of Alagaesia.

I highly highly highly recommend it. Literally cannot recommend it enough. You can get the Libby app on your phone and rent free Kindle books on the app on your phone, but the physical editions are so large and thick that it somehow makes the gravity of the story more palpable. It's like you're sitting there, holding this thick ass book (they get thicker with each story) reading this story of revolution (religiously, philosophically, politically, racially, mentally,) growth beyond what one can imagine for oneself, inner strength, family, and the lengths that one will go to protect what they love....and the sheer heft of the books makes you aware of how core changing the events of the book were for every character because it took so many pages to tell their story of radical change.

Murder at the Mena House,"I came across this mystery book at my local library and decided to give it a try. I definitely recommend it as a good read and one that sits and makes you wonder who is a murderer. I also enjoyed getting background on the character and understanding her life and getting to know the other hotel guests.

I’m really new to reading mystery novels, so at the same it does feel weird trying to guess the entirety of the book who the killer is. I wish the ending would have been a bit more suspenseful, but I will say that it is written well.

Books that become boring because you anticipate the plot,"A ton of books become boring for me half way in, because i kind of predict what will happen. So I find myself to enjoy fewer and fewer books, mostly classics. I find myself just finishing only a few books or skipping a lot of parts. Right now I read ""Chasm"" by Stephan Laws and I haven't read much of Horror / Sci-Fi books, but I'm half way in, skipping most pages, just reading 2-3 sentences to grip what is happening, even though everything is described really, really well. This book also got really good reviews and is definitly not a bad book. But I'm 250 pages in and they are still at day 3-4 of the apocalypse and everything was described well early on. Probably because nothing is really new, but it's really frustrating for me. I try to controll it by reading a couple of books at the time, so I can decide to read what I feel like to read. But that doesnt change my satisfaction with these books much.

How to write the better bookworm? Thoughts on *The Savior's Book Cafe in Another World*,"So as the canny might have guessed from the title, the story was originally a light novel (by Kyouka Izumi) although I'm reading the manga (written by Oumiya) and have made it to volume 2 thus far. I'm enjoying the art and the basic premise, which is a sort of cozy isekai where the protagonist, a thirty-something bookworm office lady, agreed to go to another world with the caveat that in additional to fantastic magical powers, she gets to spend most of her time running a bookstore cafe. 

I'm a bookworm. I like cozy fantasy. I dig it. 

However. One thing is driving me nuts and that is that the protagonist and her customer/romantic interest never once mention what they're actually reading in the story. They'll talk about how they're excited to read the next volume by that author or whether they like that trope but there are no specifics. They could be reading about high fantasy, murder mysteries, political treatises, or fly fishing for all I know. They don't throw in fake names or snippets of plot like ""oh I like those dragons."" Nada. 

And wouldn't it be interesting about how your reading habits would have to change if you went to another roughly medieval-ish world with magic? I read a lot of scifi and some astronomy and both of those would probably suddenly get a whole lot harder to procure. On the other hand, how do you write fantasy in a world with actual magic? Do you change up the magic system? Are certain volumes censored because the magic might have strategic relevance? And that's not even getting into the new literary scene you'd enter as a bookstore owner who'd presumably need to procure said books from somewhere.   

And I get it, it's a cute fun little romp, they're not going to go into all that. But it annoys and puzzles me that they can't even throw in a few fake names or genre mentions. They are writers, presumably they like reading a little bit too. Does it make more sense to leave it generic so the readers can fill in the blanks as they like?

Has anyone else had this problem with books about bookworms? What are some better examples of this done right I should look for?",books,4,1684977327.0,0.61
Issues while reading Agatha Christies novels. Need help.,"As many of my literary friends have suggested, I started reading Agatha Christie. The very first book I read is ""Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" and I completely enjoyed it. The next book I read was 'Five Little Pigs' and I consider that as one of finest piece of art, in terms of detective fiction.  


Everything was good. Later I read 4.50 from paddington, Moving finger, Mysterious Affairs at styles, where I find it difficult to finish the reading for the first two books, I couldn't complete the last one.  


I thought I need to give some try again and started 'Murder on orient express' and I am finding it very difficult to continue with it. Here are the reasons why I think I don't enjoy the books.  


1. Tooo many characters. Just too many. And it is extremely difficult to remember those names, as I am not native British/American/ Western guy. Since the names of my native people are completely different, I find it extremely difficult to remember the names.  

2. Almost no depth for characterisation. It is just plot. It's just plot and nothing else.  

3. Everything matters. She will say something happened in 34th page in 200th page and it is really difficult to remember the things happened much before. And details are micro level. A simple dialogue of 34th page matters like anything at 200th page. I mean, just 2 sentences.  

4. It is same, put it in different way. While I agree murder of roger ackroyd is an exception to it, I find many of her books, like, 4.50 from paddington are of similar theme, just the plot or puzzle is different.  


I know, we all are humans and we do have our own tastes and interests. But is there any solutions for this, that can make her books more interesting or should I move to some-other writers ?",books,14,1684949373.0,0.71

Murakami for the Nobel Prize?,"I'm just really curious what some other people out there think. I'm personally a big fan and see it as kind of a slap in the face that Ishiguro got it, at least since the committee admittedly tries to award in a more stratified way (though it'd be easier to take that claim seriously if they didn't seem so dead set on giving it to western and central Europeans, wich they still managed to do in part with Ishiguro). I'm very happy that the committee has committed to returning to its role in demarcating true literary merit and accomplishment after giving it to Dylan and ishiguro; but as a huge fan of murakami myself, I definitely admit that my love for him might impair my judgement of his merit and value, and that he perhaps is just is as populist as Ishiguro, or as punk rock as Dylan. I might also be kind of a hypocrite in the way that I so much support their having given it to Andrić rather than the obvious and popular Tolkien; it might be kind of an inverse to give it to Murakami over some relati of unknown but incredibly valuable and insightful writer. That's all my opinion.

Which audiobook narrators really elevate the books they are reading to a point where it marketedly improves the experience?,"Okay, so I generally prefer reading a book properly. There is no greater experience than connecting firsthand one-on-one with a good book, imo. 

However, when you have a few books on the go or you want to while away long journeys or getting to sleep with a good book, then the audiobook option is a must. 

Audiobooks can be tough to choose from. There are plenty of bad narrators who bore me to death and seem to drone on, killing all the joy from the novel...

However, there are some great ones who really bring the books to life and really enhance the experience. Arguably improving on the author's work.

So, which narrators do you think really enhance their work? Please include  the books they pair well with, along with the author's name.

I'll include my top three:

Santino Fontana -  as Joe Goldberg in the You series (Caroline Kepnes). The prose are so funny. He really brings them to life with so many different inflections and creative choices. Plus, he's a top-notch actor and is very convincing, it's hard to separate the character from the voice.

Stephen Fry - probably the most high-profile narrator of all time with the Harry Potter series. Some absolutely iconic voices. He really knew when to enhance the atmosphere and made the more malevolent characters so scary. Currently, listening to him narrate Animal Farm and then will progress onto 1984 (two novels I am ashamed to say have always been on my bucket list).

Steven Pacey - The First Law series (Joe Abercrombie). The guy has a whole cast of characters in his backpocket.  It's amazing how varied he is and how creative his choices are in terms of the voices - even if they're geographically jumbled, they match the characters so well. He's really pairs well with Abercrombie's dark, sinister sense of humour.",books,418,1684869587.0,0.93

Norwegian wood was flawed in the best way (my opinion),"Haruki Murakamis novel ,, Norwegian wood"" is one of his best books and it is very controversial. But I still like it. I've seen people complain about the book being misogynistic when it comes to describing the female cast, as well as being to depressing and the mc being a dick. But i think that people don't understand that that is the point. This books discusses Toru's life 17 years ago. I feel that the way everything is written is because it's from his perspective and it's in his words. The female characters are written sad, and they complain and are just made into that stereotype. But I can see them being more then that. Concerning Toru's writing about them 17 years later he might just remember certain parts of them. Like their body's, the times they complain and fight with him. Because he is a misogynistic man. All he really sees these women for are their problems and how they are in bed. Example, Naoko is mostly focused on her mental struggles and her sexual relations with Toru. Because that's how he remembers her as, he couldn't see her as anything else. Aswell as Midori, he just remembered her as a woman who fell in love with him, talked out sex, drank and fought with him. I have no doubt that she was more then that but that was the way he saw her. He's not the hero of this story. He's a bad and gross person and he's not supposed to be any other way. The point of the book is not that he's this innocent man going through all this. It's that he has a complex, he thinks he's an honest thoughtful man and that's not changing. 

This book has many flaws, from Reiko's piano backstory to the grafic way he describes sex. It's a well written book, it's not supposed to make you think a certain way. It's a book for interpretation. With rights and wrongs that are different in everyone's eyes. Thank you for reading:)",books,15,1684925713.0,0.75
Do you like reading books from the same author?,"Do you like reading books from the same author?

I don't like reading multiple books from the same author. After two or more, I feel as if I'm breaking the ""fourth wall"" and the story seems to be lost a bit. 

For example, I've read three fiction books by Matt Haig. They were all really good stories, but I could tell he wrote them all. And by the 3rd book, I could see more of Haig in the text. It never ruined the story for me, but it was 98% story and 2% Haig.

"""Trust"" by Hernan Diaz (Discussion)","I wasn't able to find a good thread about this book by searching the sub, so I thought I'd try to start my own.  I finished this novel last night.  It co-won the Pullitzer (w/ Kingsolvers ""Demon Copperhead"").  It's the 2nd Pullizter winner I've read, and I definitely liked it more than I liked The Overstory, but I still feel quite distant from it.  I don't really think I understand what the point was.  It felt strangely half-baked to me.  I don't usually want books to be longer but this felt like it needed a bit more.

To anyone else who read it, what did you think?  What do you think the message of the novel is?  I guess its about how being obscenely rich can allow to shape reality and perception of reality, even if that story has very little basis in reality.  I just felt like the book ended and I just felt like....""ok, sure.""  

I thought the first section, written by Vanner, was the most engaging.  The 2nd and 4th sections are so underwritten and unfinished.  Section 3 about the ghost writer was good, but it was also rushed and just ended suddenly.

I don't know.  I don't think Pullitzer books are for me.  Seems like they value being inventive with form and using plenty of words that I have to look up that.  Don't think I'm smart enough for this level of ""artistry.""",books,7,1684937367.0,0.71
Finally sat down with “Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow” and…,"And…I think the most unexpected theme that hit me the hardest was *grief*? I even went back to the back cover to see if it was included in the blurb, but it wasn’t and it just caught me so off guard.


I was not ready to end up weeping with this book and yet there I was. Admittedly personal stuff that connected me to the characters had to do with it, but I will say there are also some *really* beautifully written lines sprinkled throughout the book that deserve all the recognition. 

A couple thoughts to note as I closed the book;

- Marx’s chapter with the bird and the strawberry and just all of it was very well written and it *is* probably one of my favorite parts of the book —but I also hated that particular choice for his character. Felt lazy and just there for the sake of drama. 

- I wish we’d seen a bit more of that married couple’s game? I felt so strongly that Sadie should’ve seen Marx’s post-it note to her and gotten involved with that game, but she never did, and it all broke my heart a little. 

- Pioneers was so so clunky to get into, but after the reveal and Sadie even going back to say goodbye to her character it all came together okay and on re-reads I’ll probably like it more going in with a different perspective. 

- I found the Donkey Kong machine bit particularly moving near the end? Again, probably me projecting personal stuff but again, it got to me. I think the author did a really really good job with the grandparents too —both Sadie’s and Sam’s. Their genuine affection, care and love made it through the page and I appreciated that a lot. 

- The last 1/3rd of the book was very much all over the place, but at the end I did like the open ended ending, and the story coming full circle with Sam and Sadie at the airport paralleling their encounter in Boston once upon a time.

"Just finished ""1984"" by George Orwell and it tore me apart","\*spoilers at the end\*

I have always liked dystopian, and this one was horrendously twisted in all the best ways.

My favorite quote is ""That the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness, and that, for the great bulk of mankind, happiness was better."" It raises the question, is freedom is even worth it? Does the truth really matter as long as you are happy? Is ignorance truly freedom, or is it just freedom from sadness?

It's interesting how the book puts into perspective the fact that the government, or the one who has power, can change the very core of our beliefs. They can make you forget, remember, believe complete lies simply because it serves them. Not directly, but this is going on in our world right now. How many impressions of a person/concept have you developed simply by listening to others on the internet? Even though I try to find truth for myself, I admit I am guilty of going off of others.

What is truth? Is truth just defined by the one who has the most power? They control our thoughts, so they control what we think is true. And even if what we think is true is not objective truth, does it really matter? There's too much in this book I swear.

The character development was amazing. Following the protagonist Winston, you see an incredible change in his morals and mindset between the beginning and finish. It left me with a sense of helplessness reading how it ends, I wanted to scream at him to not give in. But the depressing realistic end was what made it so impactful.

Any thoughts? It'd be cool to hear some other perspectives or interpretations of 1984",books,2484,1684817975.0,0.87

Places described in books that made you feel so cozy you wanted to be there.,"I'm sure we've all read more than one books that made us feel like that. It happens to me a lot. Most of the time it is because a place is described as so beautiful and warm or simply because the characters are safe in that place and share moments of happiness. I'm gonna share two (out of many) books that made feel extremely cozy for very different reasons. The first one is ""Anne of Green Gables"". Every little detail of Avonlea village described in the book is beautiful and makes me feel warm and cozy.  Bloomed trees and flowers, picturesque houses, a dreamy lake and streets I'd love to walk into for hours. All that set in a late 19th century environment! This book just makes me wanna be there to see everything with my own eyes! Now onto the second book (book series actually) which is the whole ""Harry Potter"" series. Many would think that it's an odd choice of books to describe as ""cozy and warm"", but there are some specific places described in the books that make me feel exactly like that. One of them is Hogsmead village. I fell in love with it with the way it is described in the books. Just imagine being there in winter, walking in the snow and visiting each and every shop and pub to enjoy a butter beer, it would be a dream coming true (yes, I know it is a real village, like Avonlea, but the books make them sound even warmer and cozier for me)! The second one is Hagrid's house: I don't think I really need to explain much, it's just the definition of cozy! And last, but not least, there's Gryffindor's common room. A safe, warm and cozy place where the students of Gryffindor relax, have parties or even study at! The way it is described combined with the fact that it's actually one of the safest places in Hogwarts (nothing dangerous happened in it) and it's use as a place to relax make it one of the coziest places I've ever read about!

Romance books that aren't romance books,"I don't know if it was Reddit or another site but someone was saying in a discussion thread that they didn't think that ""Book Lovers"" by Emily Henry was a romance or that the focus was more on the protagonists bond with her sister. I think they said that it seemed more like it was marketed as a romance despite being more about the two sisters. I'd be inclined to agree. After reading Book Lovers the scenes between our protagonist and Charlie were rather sparse definitely compared to other romance novels I've read. And in each chapter you'd hear a lot about how mc worries about her pregnant sister Libby. That said it was a refreshing read and I like the sisterly love in it.

My personal honest thoughts on race in books as someone going through all the books I was forced to read from high school as an adult,"Hello lovely people of /r/books ! I've gotten back into reading through audible and the library but mostly audible over the past few months and have been loving it. I started going through books I was forced to read from high school since they are considered classics and I wanted to form my own opinion.

&#x200B;

So far in that vein I have read One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next, Of Mice and Men, 1984, and Animal Farm. I would consider the LOTR Book 1 a ""classic"" but they never gave fantasy/scifi in school, and I wasn't a fan of the book anyhow.

&#x200B;

I just wanted to share my perspective on these books as a black man who lives in America. Going through Cuckoo and Mice and Men, the writing and plot and characters were AMAZING. It was a bit hard to acclimate myself but I couldn't put things down once a few characters were developed. That said I notice a common theme in these American books from the 1900-1990s period.

I'm honestly getting kinda tired and a little put down that every one of these books has making fun or torturing a black person as a required part of the story. I do not think these sort of things should be canceled or abridged, absolutely not. Art should not be tampered with and it reflects reality of the time period. But at the same time, when I read these things and I see we are teaching these ideas to kids in schools, I legitimately feel like it's people celebrating the ""good ol' days."" Sounds absurd? Sure. But that is how I truly feel. At a glance many more of the American classics like Gatsby, To Kill a Mockingbird, and so on share similar plot devices.

&#x200B;

In a bit more reflection I notice as a kid and still to this day, I have gravitated towards scifi/fantasy. There are great themes in them that align with my personality sure, but it is such a blessing when being a colored person in a story shies in comparison to some alien or magical talking dog. I personally am of the belief that if a piece of art is not created by a colored person, it will be EXTREMELY difficult for me to relate because so much art that we source as ""classics"" that we build foundations for many more years of art are in reality made by white men, who never have to consider these problems that I do, as just another negro in America.

Questions on why a book would be more expensive after a cover change.,"I started reading “throne of glass” series by Sarah Mass last year. The first two books I bought were around $10. Life happened and I stopped reading for awhile. I just went to buy the 3rd book to continue the series. The cost of the book is now $21. I’m nearing the end of the book and was calling around to see where I bought the book for $10. After talking to a few people I was told there are two versions of the series, young adult ($11) and adult ($20), as well as a cover change. Is there actually a difference between the young adult version and the adult version ? I tried reading more on the internet but couldn’t find anything pertaining to a young adult vs adult version? My curiosity got the best of me and I’m trying to figure out the difference between the two. If any one could fill me in on why this would be so I would greatly appreciate your Input!

The Collector by John Fowles is superb.,"I recently picked up The Collector by John Fowles, which has been on my pile for some time. Part of the reason I put it off was because I assumed I could tell the whole plot from the concept - a stock crazy guy kidnaps a girl, keeps her in his basement, and she manages to convince him to release her. 

I know, I know - shame on me for quite literally judging a book by its cover. In this case my assumptions were facilitated by exposure to the Netflix show ‘You’. Been there, done that.

How wrong I was. 

This is one of the most engrossing books I’ve read in a very long time. I finished the whole thing in two days. Though it is Fowles’ first novel, I much prefer it to his later work, which is more experimental (I feel similarly about Joyce - while Ulysses is very clever, I much preferred Dubliners and Portrait and didn’t finish Finnegan’s Wake). 

That’s not to say the book lacks originality, however. The first half takes us into the mind of the book’s antagonist, Frederick Clegg, a mediocre clerk who comes into money after winning the lottery and decides to spend it on realising his darkest desires. These desires are themselves not particularly imaginative - Clegg is a stolid butterfly collector, a bureaucrat, utterly lacking in taste and creativity and representative of the worst elements of class resentment. Hannah Arendt would have appreciated the character, I think, for the banality of his evil, and he is banal. But the nature of his psychological disturbance is brilliantly portrayed by Fowles, through little details (when preparing the basement for his captive, he decides to lay down orange carpet, reasoning the colour is cheerful) and through layers of information slowly revealed over the course of the narrative. 

These layers gain greater significance through the latter half of the novel, which is narrated by Miranda, the captive, in epistolary form. We see events already related to us through fresh eyes, lending them greater significance and throwing Clegg’s abnormality into relief with new details. 

The result is a tightly structured, wholly gripping, and deeply moving novel, which I feel has something in common with Koestler’s ‘Darkness at Noon’ in its intellectual struggle between two people bound by circumstance. What is at stake is, ultimately, humanity - what it means to be human, and the debt humans owe each other - played out across battlefields of class, wealth, and art, between those who create beautiful things and those who collect and catalogue beautiful things.

Goosebumps and Animorphs.,"I have seen people compare these two book series, and they do have things in common as well as differences. These two book series are both for ages 8-12 with kids against an extranormal force. They are both violent with body horror, yet told in a way kids can understand and interpret whatever makes sense in their mind. The use of comic book sounding onomatopoeia are also identical. The differences, however, is Goosebumps for the most part are standalone books, and Animorphs is one continuous story. Goosebumps belong in the supernatural genre while Animorphs is science fiction. The violence in Animorphs is also more direct.

I was interested in Goosebumps during my later years of elementary school, reading a few books, graphic novels, and watching at least 30 episodes of the television series. Back then as a kid I was aware how the characters are in peril and the monsters were meant to be spooky. But looking back now that I have grown, these books are significantly more twisted than I remember, especially compared to the other book series I was more interested in, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and when I was even younger, Captain Underpants. I haven't been familiar with Animorphs back then, although I am sure I have passed by these at some point without knowing the content.",books,11,1684866888.0,0.64
Why did DFW develop such a unique prose style for Infinite Jest?,"I want to start this post off with some disclaimers - English isnt my first language so apologies if I phrase something awkwardly, additionally it could be that parts of IJ have flown over my head, so don't hesitate to correct me! I'm also very much an Amateur when it comes to literature, so I hope what I state isn't too obvious or trite to those who have approached this book with a more academic lense than I'm capable of doing.

I'm about 100 pages in, and I've noticed that DFW often attempts to sort of make the reading experience more challenging or oblique. There isnt a great unified plot as much as a ton of hints, which together with the footnotes creates the Illusion that the entire novel is the encyclopedia of a dystopian America. Of course I see that the footnotes enable DFW to really flesh out his characters or describe his locales much more thorougly than If all that extra Info had been awkwardly fit into the main text, but I feel like there are more motives behind employing this many footnotes rather than just good, economical exposition. 

Also, DFW seems to sometimes want to make himself extra clear, while at other times attempting to almost obfuscate whatever it is He wants to convey. As an example of the former - he sometimes adds in parentheses who or what exactly is referred to with a particular pronoun, e.g.

>It (the sunset)


On the other hand, he uses phrases like ""and so but then"" which renders the text a bit harder to read fluently. Together with the often highly technical language this sort of has the effect of driving a wedge between Reader and text. It feels like at times DFW wants the reader to know he's reading a book, which seems counterintuitive. Wouldnt an author want to conceive of a world that is purely immersive and offers itself as almost an alternate reality?

Btw, If this sounds harsh - I Love this book so far, definitely will finish. Still though, this novel makes me at times think, ""Why did he write/compose things exactly like that? It can't be just laziness or coincidence?""",books,9,1684872004.0,0.71

Absolutely loved this book! I can see why everyone raves about this and why this got Goodreads Choice Award.

&#x200B;

I have never read a science fiction with humor in it. This was my first time, and I was pleasantly surprised. It has humor in just the right places and does not overdo it.

&#x200B;

I love how it managed to put in a mix of thriller, suspense AND comedy in what was supposed to be a strictly science-fiction.

The main characters are super-likeable. I absolutely loved Ryland Grace's personality and how he did not take himself way too seriously. His ability to find comedy in very dire situations (I wish I could do that).

Eva Stratt is a freaking superwoman. I know she's fictional, but her demeanor; the way she handles stuff, made me fall in love with her. An absolute badass.

The other characters were also likeable, though they didn't get much development.

And of course, Rocky! Never did I think I would grow to love an intergalactic spider.

The Willows by Algernon Blackwood (1907) (Novella),"I recommend it. It was a direct inspiration to H. P. Lovecraft and much of the ""weird fiction"" that came after it.

The story is about the willows on the Danube river -- to say anything more would be a spoiler. 

I think it's really fascinating the way the nature in the book is described in mystic, menacing, but vital terms. I can't help but try to place it politically into it's time period. The story's protagonists are placed in a struggle against nature in isolation, but there is no element of triumph, no sense of overcoming or subjugating nature like you might find in a Jack London novel. In this world, nature is something fearful, something inscrutable, with mysteries shrouded behind leaves, and whose forces can't be commanded by human beings, but only reckoned with carefully with reverence and fear.

Perhaps it's a peer into a frightening world that lies just beyond the door of modernity. There is a hint of the xenophobia that characterizes Lovecraft's work, but it is not nearly as prominent, appearing only in passing. Still, the novella made me think of Joseph Conrad's *Heart of Darkness* (1899), in which Marlow can't help but feel that the horrors he saw on the Congo River in fact infect the River Thames, that underneath the triumphant illumination of London's civilization lurks a beating heart of darkness just the same.

*The Willows* lacks the baggage of Conrad's narrative on imperialism, mostly because it lacks the explicit politics. It lacks people generally, with only two characters in the entire story. In some ways this may be a narrative weakness, but it's also the novella's strength: Instead of asking about the hearts of men, *The Willows* projects a fear of what happens beyond the reach of urbanity, in lands where nature is still dominant. Its view of this natural world is at times romantic, and yet still always fearsome, and eventually, terrifying. Perhaps it is also a fear of the past, a terror at the thoughts of druids dealing with greater, now long-forgotten forces, before the guiding light of Christianity.

The ending is not entirely satisfying. There is no sense that the protagonists are changed by the journey, no understanding that this journey teaches them anything about their lives, no shattering of their sense of security in modern life. This sense that horror is something confined to the other, something that dwells in the remote wilderness of Hungary, but not our own homes, is the subtle xenophobia I mentioned earlier. But the novella is primarily meant to thrill and entertain, and it delivers. Check it out if you're curious -- it isn't hard to find for free, since it's in the public domain.",books,32,1684821444.0,0.97
Am i sick or Down and Out in Paris and London actually funny?,"I bought a collected work version recently , containing Down and Out in Paris and London, Animal Farm and 1984.

"""The Accursed Kings"" has brought an end to my book drought. It's fantastic.","Do you love medieval intrigues ? Do you sometimes look up at the ceiling when a story becomes absurdly unbelievable even though it pretends to respect **H**istory and its facts ? I may have something for you.

What I call the *book drought* occurs when no book is interesting enough, to the point where you start **doubting** that you actually still like reading... Have you ever even *liked* reading ?

After about two years of book drought, I stumbled upon a deshiveled, worn-out copy of ""The Cursed Kings"", Vol. 1, by Maurice Druon. It was residing in the pocket of an old jacket that someone had forgotten in the train. I know, it's not great, but I like going through other people's things. I don't like stealing though. I much prefer taking a peek at other people's lives, which I did. And in one of its pockets laid this book. I was supposed to go on vacation with my stepmom, with plenty of time to read, but hadn't found anything quite to my liking yet.

After googling it, it seemed our [George R. R. Martin liked it quite enough](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/05/maurice-druon-george-rr-martin). 

>The Accursed Kings has it all: iron kings and strangled queens, battles and betrayals, lies and lust, deception, family rivalries, the curse of the Templars, babies switched at birth, she-wolves, sin and swords, the doom of a great dynasty and all of it (or most of it) straight from the pages of history.

Even better, George liked it enought to resurrect it from the alley of the Abandoned Books : 

>The English translations … well, the seventh volume has never been translated into English, and the first six are long out of print, available only in dusty hardcovers and tattered paperbacks from rare book dealers found on AbeBooks. **But that's about to change, thanks to my own British publisher, HarperCollins, who are bringing The Accursed Kings back into print at long last.**

And that was in 2013. Everything's been translated. It's available as an audiobook, too. Here's the [link](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-iron-king-the-accursed-kings-book-1-maurice-druon?variant=32173338492962)to Harper Collin's website 

I tried it, and boy did it not disappoint.

Druon, who's an accomplished historian, has the ability to exploit the darkened corners of history to weave his excellent storytelling. Between the scientifially correct lines, there's freedom for the writer. And that's precisely where he sculpts his historically accurate stories, behaviors and interactions thanks to the assistance of his collaborators.

>Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Allan Massie praised Druon's ""thorough research, depth of understanding and popular touch"".

The Penal Colony by Richard Herley (1987),"With the upcoming 1-year anniversary of Ray Liotta's passing, I was reminded by a movie he starred in called No Escape (1994). [Here's a trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHSwdSTETXA) Since the last time I watched the movie, I've become a book collector so I obviously wanted to read the book the movie was based on. I just finished the book - **The Penal Colony** by Richard Herley - and I wanted to write a quick review and a brief comparison with the movie.

To start, the movie has only passing resemblance to the book and - as is the case with most books I've read - the book is significantly better. So if you liked the movie, you'll love the book a lot more. Spoilers for both the movie and the book follow but you can skip to the last paragraph to avoid spoilers.

Quick overview of both book and movie. A man is sent to an isolated prison island with no guards or rules. On one side is a safe community called The Village (the Insiders in the movie) where everyone works together for the same goal under the totalitarian leadership (or more beneviolent leadership in the movie) of one person. The other part is ruled by law of the jungle with various tribes trying to stay alive and gain power. The story is about a person who is exposed to both camps, finds their place in The Village, fends off an attack by the tribes, and ultimately escapes from the island.

The movie doesn't waste time veering from the original material. Including a long credits scene, it only takes two and a half minutes to completely change the main protagonist. In the book, the main character is Anthony Routledge who is a quantity surveyor, wrongly convicted for a rape/murder (not to mention a UK/Irish based people/location in the book). The main character in No Escape is a more Americanized John Robbins who was not only guilty of first degree murder but he was a highly trained Marine. Considering both men are dropped off into a prison island with no rules, the latter has no problems adapting to the environment. In the book, Routledge has very lengthy journey where he goes from a ""civilian"" to a surviving member of the prison island. Mr. Robbins has no problems killing. Routledge has serious problems with it where his first kills have stayed with him for some time. Interestingly - and perhaps I'm giving the author too much credit here - but the description of all kills done by everyone (and there aren't too many) have been given fewer and fewer words as the book progresses. I'd like to believe that the author intended for the killings to be treated as the norm for the island so you, as the reader, are simply more used to the violence and therefore wouldn't pay as much attention to it.

I'm sure I can nitpick both the book and the movie to death but the movie is definitely made for its audiences. Mr. Robbins is a trained killer who quickly adapts anywhere he's been thrown into, he quickly grabs the most valuable weapon on the island, and is desired by the more peaceful, civilized group living in isolation from the more extreme members. There he quickly becomes a critical part of the team and literally leads them to freedom at the end after personally killing the main antagonist. Typical Hollywood movie that needs a Gary Stu. The book has almost none of these elements. Routledge is almost immediately kicked out of the safety of the Village to fend for himself as a test. He is almost raped and killed soon after, only to be captured and nearly sold off to be a sex slave. He escapes through luck, grabs the most he can, almost doesn't make it back to the Village, where he's barely tolerated and has very few friends until his ultimate but very slow rise in the ranks. Instead of being a Gary Stu, he has only one specific but important task. He's not a killer, inventor, tactician, or a leader. He's just an cog in a machine with lots of other moving pieces. He's almost sidelined as other players do most of the heavy lifting as far as the major point of the story - an eventual escape via boat.

The other huge change is that the movie has a mole, played by the always scene-stealing Ian McNeice of Rome/Dune (2000) fame (in my mind, at least). The book has no such mole and nobody worked with the Warden who ultimately gets theirs in the movie. The book has no such sense of karma. There is also no character of Casey (played by Kevin Dillon) for the protagonist to care about. Routledge is on his own for most of the book and trying to fit in.

There were a few other changes like he has a then-wife and son in the book while the movie has nothing. Instead of numerous tribes in the movie (though living mostly together), there are only two in the book who live apart and skirmish often. The main antagonist in the book is a high-ranked player but the tribal leadership changes hands several times before he takes over. The book has a lot more details of what it would actually be like to live in a place like this. The movie does a lot of yada-yada. Although the end-result are fully operational machines - an amazing work by the onsite engineers - they are not terribly probable given the resources available (i.e. lots of reliance on mostly wood in the movie rather than mostly plastic/polyethylene materials in the book).

There are a few parts of the book which I didn't find extremely appealing and perhaps this was a product of its time and its target audience (or maybe it's just me). Obviously there are several references to rape though none were described. The general feeling - considering this was written in the time of AIDS - is a general anti-homosexual vibes though in only a few references. Specific references to try to avoid touching blood just in case they had AIDS and being removed from The Village for having gay intercourse.

While the book is definitely superior and more plausible in what would happen in this kind of a situation, the movie does have its moments. Again, the working machinery - including an elevator - were all built and are fully functioning and built based on materials that could have existed on the island. There is also an amazing [waterfall drop scene](https://youtu.be/MWbYHcrTXcI?t=406) that has rarely been duplicated, especially considering this was shot in real life with no CGI. Watch the whole video which is a Behind the Scenes of the movie. The antagonist - Walter Marek (played by Stuart Wilson) does an excellent job being the proper type of crazy for the island while the book has several completely forgettable antagonists. The movie also talked about corporations running prisons - again, the movie came out in 1994 - and it's a bit on the nose to some of the recent headlines. This was interesting to note since in the book - which came out in 1987 - treatment of these types of prisoners was referencing a fictional Penal Colonies Act of 1991. In the UK, private prisons were allowed after the passing of the Criminal Justice Act of... 1991. [More info...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Justice_Act_1991).

To sum up, if you really liked the movie No Escape then you'll really enjoy reading The Penal Colony. If you're wondering what it would be like for a regular man with little ""street"" experience to live in an isolated island that's filled with killers and rapists then you'll enjoy the book too. The book really holds your hand while you go on this journey together with our very poor protagonist. You'll wonder how you'd do in a similar situation. How many of us would lose hope, how many would turn savage, and how many of us would do anything to survive and, perhaps, prosper or least find your place in the world.",books,4,1684844835.0,0.83
Just read The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien,"If I read this book when it was originally released in 1937, I think my head would explode like a pumpkin. Like handing an iPhone to a 1600’s farmer.

I grew up watching the Lord of the Rings movies and they hold a special place in my heart as a movie buff. I decided it was finally time to read it all for myself — Starting at The Hobbit.

This book is one I was sad it came to an end. The characters are written better than almost anything I’ve ever read in my life and the adventure that we follow Bilbo Baggins on throughout the book throws you into one of the most beautiful and magical worlds to ever be created.

I have always understood that Lord of the Rings is considered much better than The Hobbit, just like the movie versions. But I can’t wrap my head around how that will even be possible. The way Tolkien wrote this book was so perfectly executed by keeping it simple enough to easily follow along while being detailed enough to have my heart racing during key moments. What a beautiful talent…

As a side note…I listened to the audiobook for most of this book due to time constraints.

One is that our writer has the money to get cover our professionally done even if it is photographs, wanted to do so. However, if you want to cannot afford a professionally done cover art there is no particular reason why an AI generated image can't be used as a cover for. Likewise another prevailing thought that we have had is that since AI draws upon images it finds using keywords and if one knows how to then one you should use Photoshop to manipulate things like faces or anything else that looks suspiciously copyrighted for at the very least to make something look a little bit more authentic.


We are curious to see what other people think about this topic..",books,0,1684905379.0,0.36
Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel,"Overall, I felt the book was bad.  Aside from finding it boring and the characters flat, unsympathetic and unengaging, I couldn't find any literary merit to it.  It had some interesting narrative elements and I felt like it was trying to do something, but it was more of a nagging sensation, like a child tugging on my shirt while I'm looking at something else entirely.  I'm guessing the show was better because when looking for a subreddit on the book, all I found were subreddits on the show.  The book was definitely the worst apocalypse-type book I've read, worst pandemic-type book I've read, and worst cultVStravelingtroupe-type book I've read and the repetitive ""it was two weeks before the last x"" was banal to the point I assumed it was satire, which apparently it wasn't.

The book had most of the worst characters and character development of all books I've read, and the writing was basically on par with Harry Potter / Eragon.  It reminded me a lot of John Scalzi's The Kaiju Preservation Society in how terrible the characters, arcs, and writing were.  In fact, that's one of the only other books I stopped reading and then finished just to validate my dislike of it and make sure there was not, in fact, any substantial redeeming qualities.  His book Old Man's War, is much better and I honestly don't know how his publisher let KPS get published; similarly, I feel like a lot of people did Emily St. John Mandel as massive disservice letting Station Eleven get published in its current form.  Three or four more revisions and it's possible she would have had something there, but it felt like Dan Brown wrote it.  The few ""surprises"" were conspicuously foreshadowed which left nothing interesting to discover.  Marissa or whatever her name was - the one who wrote the graphic novel - had the most potential to be developed into someone interesting.",books,0,1684896236.0,0.39

"A book that you come back to reread again and again throughout your life. You read it when you were a kid, in your early 20s, as an adult, and you will read it again when you get older.","what would it be?  Which book has had such a profound impact on you that you feel compelled to return to it time and time again?

&#x200B;

For me, it's Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday. I read it when I was in high school, during my undergrad years, and in graduate school. I love this book. If I were stuck on an island, the material and problems in this book would keep me busy and sane for a year. Reading the same book as time goes by can be a transformative experience. It offers an opportunity to witness the evolution of our own worldview and personal growth. For me, I read this book as a kid and didn't understand the Biot-Savart law. However, when I reread it during my undergraduate years, this law became crystal clear to me. It's amazing how the book remains the same, but you, as a person, are not. Something has changed as we grow up.

&#x200B;

 If you want to understand the basic laws that govern our universe, I would not recommend The Brief History of Time by Hawking or other popular science books. Instead, I would recommend you to read this book. The Feynman Lectures on Physics is also a good book, btw.",books,571,1684727964.0,0.95
Can books fill the void of social connections in life?,"I'm an incredibly lonely person and for a good while books have allowed me to feel fulfilled to an extent in life. It is the only kind of escapism that feels meaningful and satisfying to me. I have grown so comfortable just staying in my room to read all the time, that I am now unable to see the point of friendships and the effort needed to keep and maintain them. I still feel like something is missing. I am still lonely but I don't want friends?? Idk its weird. 

I feel like I'm constantly detached from reality and thinking about the characters and worlds in the books I have read even when I'm not reading. I feel closer to all these characters than I have ever felt to another person in my whole life. I wish I could talk to them. I feel like they would understand me and accept me as I am. 

Sometimes when I can't read I feel really dreadful because in those moments I'm forced to face my reality. Its like I don't even exist. I have no friends or connections really and even my own family shuns me. But I don't even necessarily desire to be socially relevant. 
I am too unfit for the real world and I'm too sensitive to my own emotions, so much so that I feel the need to dissociate and numb myself and feel apathy towards real life experiences. I enjoy what I experience when I read and i can at least handle living vicariously through book characters. 

I know living in my own head can't be good for me. I am a flesh and blood human and I actually exist even though I may not like it. But I also don't hate lviing like this. I just worry I'll have a lot of regrets about wasting my youth when I get older i guess( I'm 22 btw).",books,149,1684750233.0,0.88
How do you read in mind?,"I am interested in the experience of people who have devoted a lot of time to reading. When I read, I always subvocalize it in my head. And I feel how over time the tension increases and along with it the reading speed decreases as well, it becomes more difficult and takes more time to grasp the meanings of words. Thus, I realize that I am tired and put the book down for a while. I noticed that this happens just when I'm about to pass thirty and more pages consistently. I had a tought that over time I would be able to endure longer distances. But at the same time, I remember that I heard that people can train themselves not to read the words in their mind, but just read by looking at the text, and I heard that it helps to read faster. I tried to do this, but I noticed that although I can recognize the words, I have a hard time understanding the context and remembering what i just read.

So, people who spend a lot of time reading, i'm interested in your toughts, may be you had something similar and you got over it, or may be you found or developed more effective methods of reading?",books,1,1684833557.0,0.52
I finally accept i don't like reading,"For the last 3-4 years of my life-I am a 23 years old man-, I tried to force myself to read, i sit and read even though i didn't enjoy. I tried, classics(Dostoevksy, Tolstoy, I
Orwell), fantasy(Tolkien, Sanderson, George Macdonald, Will Wight), science fiction(James S. A. Corey) , historical fiction(Bernard Cornwell, Walter Scott, Henryk Sienkiewicz) most of the time i didn't enjoy reading. It was always felt like a chore rather than a fun hobby I always thought ""Nah it is not reading itself that I dislike, it is just the book or genre"" but everytime i read a new book result was same. I tried to understand why, why i try to engage in an activity that feels like a chore? Answer is simple because i always thought reading is ""cool"" and ""productive"" and something smart people do.

How are the books on amazon labelled 'Used Like New',"I am a student. I want to buy a book from Amazon.

Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell,"I finished this book the other day and honestly it was so amazing and I feel like nothing else I read will amount to the experience. 

As the story progressed, I really fell in love with the characters. The historical setting intermingled with the magical aspects in such a unique and creative way. It was so beautifully written and both the world-building and characterizations were amazing.

 There were so many interesting ideas that were brought up too, such as those regarding racial issues and mental health. 

I also love how Lord Byron randomly appears haha. 

The mixing of darker/heavier elements of the story was interspersed with little bits of humour to balance it out and I loved loved loved it. A very good book for people like me who love magical realism but don't want something super heavy/dark/depressing/disturbing.

Honestly such a great book that I want to reread, and definitely a story that will stick with me for a while.

Genre Writing vs. Literature,"Hey everyone, sort of new here.

Wanna start off by saying I was a literature minor throughout college but have transitioned into being an editor for several literary magazines. I write a lot, but don't put anything out, as it's mostly for refinement right now.

I was trying to find a literary community on reddit. I think this subreddit is great, as anybody who reads is genuinely better off than anyone who doesn't (this is super controversial, but I'm maybe in the right place. Reading is magical to me, and easily the reason that I'm alive. I'm not gatekeeping reading, or judging those who don't, but it's simply the best thing in my life besides music).

What I've found is that the people here don't read the sort of things I see are common in literary circles. All of us in any group I've been in can list off short story writers we like, and most of us can list off specific short stories we care for. I understand that short stories are more of a craft thing, but even when we talk about our favorite books, they either tend to be part of the literary canon, or something extremely contemporary (which everyone immediately fixates on and writes down on hearing, for later reading).

I'm wondering, why is this gap so present in r/Books? 99% of the posts are about Y.A. literature, which I think is totally okay and good to read (hell, I LOVED twilight and hunger games), but I'm looking for more likeminded people when it comes to ""reading that takes serious work, and isn't always enjoyable"".

I read old Russian literature (Brothers K, Anna K, Crime and P, Life and Death of Ivan Ilyich). My favorite book is Moby Dick. I read a lot of David Foster Wallace (everything he's every written, a lot of it multiple times), Cormac McCarthy, Denis Johnson, Don DeLillo, and George Saunders. These are what I consider vital to the contemporary writers' breadth.

Where are the people who read this kind of shit? Is there a specific subreddit? Are we a dying breed? When I meet someone in real life who reads any of these authors, it's like finding a unicorn. I want to be able to replicate that experience online, so I can talk with someone who actually understands the insane writing that has been put out in the last couple centuries, and our conversations just flow smoother, almost easily.

P.S. This reads like a super pretentious shitpost, but I guarantee I am 100% serious. And I don't judge anyone who loves The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.",books,13,1684790698.0,0.62
Late night gas station met Socrates after reading the feelings,"Everyone tells you what to do and what's good for you because they don't want you to find the real answers. People are afraid of their hearts, which happen to be the only place they belong.  
  
The carriage at 2:00 a.m. was less noisy than during the day, and the seats were so far to the east that it was really hard to sleep.  
  
I suddenly remembered that there was a book in my bag that had been on the shelf for a long time, thinking that it could also kill a little time.  
  
The train is actually a good place to read, the intermittent signal can let you and the phone temporarily separated, the carriage of people of all colors each boring and relatively speechless, and occasionally and the opposite people chatting a few words, followed by a long silence.  
  
A book at this time seems to make the time a little faster, not boring and uncomfortable. So I met it on the train late at night, faded away and met a different world.  
  
This is a book that I overheard and read because I was curious, but it was hard to read it in its entirety.  
  
This book is said to be ""the heart-saving pill of the restless world"", I do not believe this evil, a book can have so much charm?  
  
This is a short and concise book for the soul. It is a short and concise storyline about the nodes on the road to spirituality. It is more like a guide to action, admitting that one is a prisoner of life and that life is the external reality of one's own compiled story. The head is so convinced of the reality of life that it indulges in it, it can't help itself.  
  
The first thing that struck me in the article was that Dan, the main character, watched his life in Socrates' gas station. The fading dreams and unfortunate marriages are all common and helpless phenomena nowadays, which are resisted by the heart but pale in comparison. Perhaps only after seeing the results, people will have the sense of urgency to reflect on the process.  
  
The Socrates in the text is a magical person, calm and wise, plainly doing ordinary things, but the simplicity of having seen the world and experienced the universe and a thousand lives. The character of Socrates is an amalgamation of all the mentors in the author's life. He is an old man in the gas station, dedicated to his work, seriously treating every passing customer, he will also drink tea and sit peacefully in the sofa, will also be naughty to fool the young people, flirtation and teasing. But there are always a few moments, there are always a few words, will make you enlightened, make a lot of re-choice.  
  
I know that I always have to choose among many options, and then focus and focus again, and the moment I do the best, my heart will be incomparable peace. And in the process of making anything, focus on doing, rather than from any perspective other than the thing itself to look at, will be in every ordinary day, the accumulation of great energy.  
  
A ""life-saving pill"" for a fickle world, it is worth your time to savor, a thousand people have a thousand Hamlets, only their own personal experience, to know whether there will be gains.  
  
Late Night Gas Station Meets Socrates"" wonderful quotes  
  
1. Before you start learning, you have to empty your gas tank first.  
  
3. Knowledge alone is not enough; knowledge has no heart. Life must take the right action to bring knowledge to life. ""You know, but you don't take action, you are not a warrior.  
  
6. If you choose to change the present, you can change the future.  
  
7. Your mind (that big pile of remorse, longing and fantasy) is your dilemma.  
  
8. you are simply too happy to change anything, but just refuse to change yourself.  
  
9. The source of your mood is your mind, not others, and not your environment.  
  
12. - How to reduce the noise of your mind and tame the wild horses of your mind?  
  
\-- It is good practice to develop a very good sense of humor and to imitate the positive characteristics of various animals.  
  
16. Everything has a purpose, it's up to you to make the best use of it. There is no such thing as an accident. Everything is a homework assignment.  
  
17. A warrior does not seek pain, but if it comes to him, he will take advantage of it.  
  
18. The warrior's domain is guarded by a gate. Each of us has the ability to find and pass through this door, but only a few of us are interested in doing so.  
  
A proper diet allows you to take advantage of the sun's energy as directly as possible. This energy helps you focus and sharpen your concentration to a sharp edge. Eat only wholesome foods and only the portions I need.  
  
21. The joy of eating is not in the taste of the food or the feeling of a full belly, but in enjoying the whole process - the chewing, the deep breathing, the sniffing, the tasting, the swallowing, the light but overflowing energy after the meal ..... Once you give your full attention to each element of the process, you will begin to appreciate the simplicity of eating.  
  
22. Death is not harmful at all. Just think of death as a transformation that is slightly more intense than the transformation of adolescence, which is just a change in the body that happens naturally when it's supposed to.  
  
23. The true martial arts teach one not to resist, just as a tree bends to the wind. Never struggle against anyone or anything. ..... Find the natural path, go with the flow, and become one with the forces of nature.  
  
26. Warriors live in the present moment, here (here and now)! Your sorrows, your fears and anger, regrets and guilt, your envy, plans and longings live only in the past or the future.  
  
27. Don't let anyone or anything, let alone your own thoughts, take you away from the present moment. Focus your attention on the present moment.",books,6,1684804208.0,0.61
A book you slow-read on purpose.,"A couple of months ago, I bought the Penguin edition of Van Gogh's Letters. I was interested in reading diaries of writers and artists, but I didn't think it was a good idea to read the Letters in the same way you read a novel, so I decided to try something different.

Every other day or so, I will read around ten pages slowly, taking my time. At the pace I'm going, it will probably take me the whole summer to finish it, but I'd like to enjoy my time with it while other stuff is happening in my life.

Thoughts about No longer human : An uncompromising book,"There is a struggle when you can't understand the norms through which we humans operate in society. The author finds himself in this predicament as he realizes he is missing the lack of skills humans possess as we interact and go about our daily lives. Why do we, as individuals, behave that way? Why can’t we would be just open instead of going out of our way to hurt people? Most of the things we do get come from a position of deceit or as a token to  want something particular from us. The author finds himself in disarray as he gets consumed with putting up a face, as the world expects. He cannot express his true self and realizes he is putting up an act or better termed as a farce for an audience, for enthralling an audience and hiding away his insecurity. He is just putting up with people, mortified by the feeling of interacting with others. If only he could understand humans better and what is expected of him, then maybe life would be a tad more tolerable.

The author bares his soul out in the novel. The author is adequately able to express his feelings and what he is thinking as he goes about dealing with a horrible tragedy for him the life is. The book is agonizing, tragic, and filled with observations that may stop right in the tracks and force you to ponder the uncomfortable questions that the author dares to question and argue.

The book is divided into multiple parts, each of which serves a different role in the story; however, both are equally tragic, with the second half of the novel being more hopeless as it showed some semblance of hope before it came all crashing down. The protagonist's monologues and his observations on the world might hit too close to home, particularly for someone who suffers from depression primarily. The prose is profoundly nihilistic however fits well with the nature of the protagonists in the story. The astute nihilism in concoction with the story's events is profoundly tragic and upsetting. Thus the pupil who is not doing too well mentally and currently going through episodes of depression and anxiety might want to hold off on the book for some time.

For everyone else, I recommend this book, the book may never stop spiraling you down the hole, but the book serves well to look deep within your heart and face some questions. Some questions might fundamentally change how you observe the world and force you to meet some uncompromising realizations. Ultimately, the book might linger in your mind much after completing it as it compels you to analyze many dealings with life through the protagonist's lens, questioning some of the life events.

The book was inspired partly by the author's life. It is agreed upon the book is the author’s memoir shortly before he took his life. This is deeply dreadful, however unsurprising, given the author’s life and thoughts described in the book. The book is very humanistic and manages to keep things grounded despite the large nihilism exhibited by the author and the events described. It makes sense the author’s journey inspires it because it’s hard to imagine someone writing this from the point of fiction unless he is the intended study. It’s as if the author’s final cry for help is to put out to the world what he feels before succumbing to death.",books,18,1684747620.0,0.82
Just finished 'Remains of the Day' by Kazuo Ishiguro,"I won't spoil the story too much beyond saying it's about an English butler who dedicated his life to his job from the 1920's -50's.
 
The book has left me with a strange feeling of constriction. The whole point of it is that the character is so uptight to a point of near absurdity - but so is the world around him. The emotional constipation seems so thoroughly damaging on a personal level that the writing becomes nearly painful. It depicts a world I am glad I do not live in. 

This isn't Ishiguro's first work that I've read (actually it's the 4th, I realised just now) and this does seem to be a theme in his writing. I wonder if it's something he has struggled with in his own life or just a particular point of fascination which he can transfer so excellently to the page. 

For me, the book carries a very subtle sense of the uncanny and weird. I almost expected a mask to be lifted at any moment and something horrible and other-worldly to be revealed. At the same time, I don't think at all that the story is one of our world - it seems rather to have taken place in another realm, perhaps a psychological one. I was almost disappointed with the ending, expecting a slightly grander revellation. 

Nonetheless, Ishiguro is beyond doubt a writer deserving of the awards he has received. Just for the writing style alone this book is worth a recommendation to anyone who enjoys reading.",books,128,1684702315.0,0.97

How important is good female representation in books?,"I was wondering about this recently, seeing for some reason a surge in love towards Muraki Murakami's works on different social media platforms.

Men and women both seem to be in love with Murakami's writing, even though he pretty much only portrays women as objects, carriers for male desires, fantasies or ""pixie-girl"" 12yo boy wet dreams. 

His female characters are shallow, unrealistic, excited by the thought of their own tampons, obsessed by their boobs and absolutely, entirely useless on their own. Despite all of this, Murakami is being acclaimed as a wonderful writer, one of the best of the 21st century, and almost no one critizes him for his ridiculous portrayal of women.

Are most people able to bypass digusting, weird and simply bad portrayal of women in books simply because of an engrossing atmosphere or a few good metaphors? Am I crazy for being unable to like a book with sexist writing?",books,0,1684788668.0,0.49

Beyond Reach by Karin Slaughter,"This book came out in about 2006, I believe. I’ve known the ending for a while without having actually read the series. Earlier this month, I decided I would start the series. It was okay and it took me a while to warm up to Jeffery since he cheated on Sarah in the beginning of the series. But, given I knew that Jeffery died at the end of Beyond Reach, I found myself slowing down how much I was reading because I didn’t want their story to end that way. Yesterday, I picked the book back up and powered through those feelings. I finished it a few minutes ago.

And, as the only reader in my household, no one understands the temporary book hangover / emotional entanglement you can have with a series and characters. So I needed to just vent into the void of the internet. 

I know that Sarah eventually moves on and is happy in another series. But it sucks that they are happily celebrating and flirting with each other about adopting a baby. Jeffery is strutting around that he has a son and calls Sarah a Foxy Mama right before the mailbox bomb goes off and kills him. Sarah runs to him and sees his heart beating through an open chest wound and his arm laying down the road a bit. He’s trying to tell her “only ever you” as she kisses him and begs him not to die. 

It’s just all so fucking quick and sad. It rapidly went from the hugest high to the lowest low. And the scene isn’t even two full pages. After a whole ass series, that’s the death scene. I’d built it up in my head so much that I at least thought it’d be drawn out. Or there would be another chapter of Sarah grieving a bit. Maybe a flash forward. Nope. It just ends.

Before February of 2022 I was an addict stuck in my ways, severely depressed and suicidal. But for some reason out of no where when my parents wanted me to come back to my home country to heal and seek treatment, I had the sudden urge to start reading again. I have no idea why I was dealt that urge. The very first book I read was Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut. 

I enjoyed the book but I guess a few things here and there slipped my mind when I read it. But as expected considering I have not read in such a long time. 

Fast forward to now of May 2023, I am still reading. At the moment I am reading Silence by Shūsaku Endō and it’s probably my favorite book of all time so far. 

Reading as helped me in quite a few ways. One of which I have noticed the increase use of vocabulary. If I’m not aware of a certain word I note it down on my Goodnotes app. I have a virtual notebook dedicated to words I learned from books and it’s so much fun to use. 

Comparing now to when I first started reading, I’ve noticed I’m able to comprehend more in the stories I read. 

I’ve noticed I’ve become a lot more empathetic and open minded to people. I think before acting. I think before I speak. I go to bed with a clearer mind at peace. I can go on about how reading has helped and changed me but I think you probably get the gist. 

In the current moment of my life, I am sober, going to start college soon, and have a new job helping and mentoring those with special needs and am in love with my job. 

I felt the need to share this with someone. And if you read this I want to say thank you for taking time to listen. 

If anyone is curious I’ll write down all the books I’ve read so far. I realize it’s *very* tiny amount compared to the amount you guys have read but I am proud of it, and I look forward to reading more books in my life.

How frequently do you reread books?,"I cannot say that I frequently read novels a second time, which probably negates the concept of owning them.  I have about 200.  I have read Lord of the Rings three times.  I've read 1984, Animal Farm, and Lolita more than once.  I love owning books.  

There are many books that I want to read again such as Middlemarch, Anna Karenina, Catch 22, and many others.  However I could instead read a book that I have not yet read.  I mean there are only so many books that we can read during our limited existence here.",books,14,1684730768.0,0.74

When I checked the reviews, I was taken aback by the amount of hate it received!

I feel as if I have rediscovered reading again,"I used to be an avid reader, consuming about 3-4 novels a month; more or less depending on the length.  During the past year I have read maybe 2 books.  I have been spending most of my spare time doing other things like photography as well as online poker (which I make a nice little secondary income from).  To be honest I dislike what I have done with my life in the past couple years and need to right the trajectory of my career path.    
I have been looking forward to my 1hr or more of reading every night now, and well feel as if I'm living vicariously through the books I read.  Not sure if it's good or bad, but I feel it is good for my mental health.  What does reading mean to others here?",books,9,1684731268.0,0.72

Unraveling the Enigma of 'House of Leaves': A Unique Foray into Psychological Horror,"At first glance, 'House of Leaves' by Mark Z. Danielewski may seem like a book about a house that's bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. However, as you delve deeper, you'll realize it's far more complex than that. The real horror of this narrative isn't in ghostly apparitions or ghastly monsters, but in its disorienting structure and the creeping sense of unease it cultivates.  
  
'House of Leaves' is a book that almost resists being read. It's a labyrinth of footnotes, appendices, and tangents that weave a haunting tale of their own. The book's structure mirrors its content - a labyrinthine house that defies the laws of physics, a narrative that defies traditional structure.  
  
One of the most striking aspects of this book is its physical layout. Text is scattered across the page, some sections require a mirror to read, and others send you spiraling through an endless maze of footnotes. It is as much a visual journey as it is a reading experience, a puzzle that the reader is compelled to solve.  
  
In essence, 'House of Leaves' isn’t just a book, but an experience. It explores the terrifying unknown, the fear of losing oneself, and the terror of a reality that is constantly shifting and redefining itself.  
  
For anyone looking for an unconventional read that blurs the line between author and reader, fiction and reality, 'House of Leaves' is a must-read. It's a book that demands your attention, challenges your perception, and stays with you long after you've turned the final page.

I just finished A Short Stay in Hell by Steven L. Peck and I don't know what to do with myself now.,"The basic premise of the book is that a man is sent to a hell, and his hell is basically just the library of babel - which contains all possible books that can ever be written, with all possible combination of characters. All the character has to do to get out of the hell, is find a book that describes his life exactly. And the character now has perfect memory, he'll remember every single detail of his life, both on earth and in hell.

So the hell has nice food, great accommodation, company and everything you need to thrive. So when I started reading the book, it didn't really feel like hell to me. But once the author gets into the enormity of the task before the character, I felt truly, utterly horrified. My mind can't grasp the sheer scale of the library, the number of books, and how long it would take for the character to find the book. I wasn't even scared about being trapped in the library, what scared me was the time scales. At such large time scales, where you can't die and are forced to stay alive, does anything truly matter? I can't even put into words the horror of living an eternity makes me feel. There can't be anything in the universe that will make eternity interesting. 

I haven't read any books that give me existential dread. But this book does, and it gave me that dread without ever describing a monster or a novel, unimaginable thing. I am thoroughly impressed, and now i am not sure what to do with myself.",books,205,1684665757.0,0.97
The Poverty Industry By Daniel L. Hatcher, The Poverty Industry by Daniel L. Hatcher will leave you jaw dropped. It’s a must-read for anyone interested in understanding the crazy web of financial interests that profit from poverty in America.

The book is a powerful call to action to reform our broken systems and prioritize the needs of those living in poverty.

Just finished „Anatomy- a love story“ by Dana Schwartz,"It started so well.. a woman who is ambitious in pursuing her goals and wants to become a doctor. I loved the plot with the medical exam and if it was just that, and the whole story revolved around a woman pursuing her goals despite the challenges and maybe a little bit of infinite life (which I genuinely predicted 57 pages in), then that would be 5 stars for sure. But no, we didn't get that. I know it's a ""love story"" too, but I've never read anything more forced in my life. The ""love"" was forced, there were no things in common except that they were nice to each other. She lost her focus and SPOILERS in the end she gives HIM eternal life instead of herself to pursue the passion she ALWAYS had?? She could take the potion and heal people with the rest but she gave everything to Jack.. the chemistry between them wasn't right for me. Too bad.

Yellowface By R.F. Kuang,"Another banger from Rebecca, this book was so INFURIATING. I hated the narrator, and that’s because you’re supposed to. But it’s so irritating!!!!!!!!

I want to know how everyone took this book. The narrator’s reality is, in my opinion, altered at best. Because what do you mean June was barely friends with Athena, when throughout the story we get flashbacks of them in college. After college, we know Athena gets a book deal of a lifetime, and combining it with June’s experience of touring and events to promote “her” book, there’s barely time to hang out. So OF COURSE, they’re going to meet quarterly as adults. I felt like Athena put so much trust into June and June with all her resentment never thought the same way about Athena. 

And that made me so mad. The narration is off the bat untrustworthy, and you see it more solidified that June is a bonafide bitch and a half when she sprinkles micro aggressions at the Asian people she meet.

At the end of the book I had so much residual anger I had to take deep breaths and unclench my fists. No other author could give me such a visceral reaction and I LOVE RF Kuang for it. If she’s in this Reddit, I have a diamond ring and a knee that bends for you Ms. Kuang, do with it however you’d like to. ❤️",books,10,1684718054.0,0.71
Can't Read Harry Potter Again,"I am sure some people can commiserate or connect with me here.

I began reading Harry Potter after the first movie came out but before I saw it. I had always been an avid and voracious reader as a child but this was a series that captured my imagination so much that it actually brought my mom to tears.

She got me all the books even books six and seven on release which wasn't easy because we didn't have a lot of money at the time but she knew it was important to me.

I haven't been able to read and enjoy those books since she passed away because the memories are so strong and even though she never read them my mom would ask me about the characters, the world, what was the difference between the books and the movies and we'd discuss the characters she liked in the movies. 

She was a huge reader as well but didn't want to read the books.

Do you forget the plot and characters of books that you have read?,"I'm an avid reader, though nowhere near what I used to read.   More often than not I don't read books a second time unless I would get something out of a second reading, or if I forgot about the story.  I have read hundreds of books, though I'm sure there are those here that have read thousands.  There are books that I have read more than 10 years ago that are among my favorite of all time, but yet I remember virtually nothing.  These books include Dr Zhivago, Middlemarch, and David Copperfield.  I remember the funeral procession in the beginning of Dr Zhivago, and I remember the little boy that decided who to leave his toys to before he died in David Copperfield.

Does the number of books you read really matter?,"Before anything, this may just pertain to the psychology of readers as a topic of this post rather than the activity of reading per se. 

I always wrestled with this notion of # of books finished = how well-read you might seem/are. How accurate or strong is the relationship between these two variables above? 

I could see myself reading and finishing many books as if it were a race to prove to other people how well read I am or can be but realistically we tend to forget and ultimately fail to apply most of the points made in the nonfiction books we read. 

This is no personal attack to any reader but I just want to address how we may feel about people like me who read slow and try to ingest the information from a book fully and properly to ultimately benefit from the content of the book we are reading. As opposed to people that race through the books they own just to claim that they can read a higher number of books than the average person.",books,0,1684799119.0,0.36
how do you even react to norwegian wood (murakami) !?,"i just finished it. i have a lot of thoughts, but they're not coming to me like they should. i just feel like my brain is swirling like a drain right now, or that it's raining up there. regardless, here's what i think... right now. what do you think !? honestly, there's a lot of controversy around the way murakami writes his female characters-- which i do, most times, agree with. i wrote some of my opinions on that but i'm leaving them out because this is just for sake of feeling i get from the entire book. im so entranced, i want to know what everyone else feels.

&#x200B;

a lot of murakami’s main characters are all the same guy. and while i don't think its good on paper, its not inherently terrible once you read the books. they’re all quiet, skeptic men who stay inside and read a lot of books and likes music. and have a strange obsession with a girl.  
but each time,  i always get the sense of some level of relatability within these characters.. i mean, it feels entirely logical to run away for a month and sleep in a sleeping bag on the beach for a month sometimes. it almost gives me an urge to begin to do that, even if im not feeling any pain in the moment.   
its as if he is writing his own personal journal entries of his life as he goes through each page. each moment is so blissful, or so momentary, that you almost only catch it for a second before the next thought is introduced. a brilliant sequence will occur of a worthwhile thought from the mc, and the atmosphere will bloom out into what happens next. people watch the streets of the city around, bugs make noise, people chatter, even though there’s no indication of people around; you still know the feeling is there.

  
so then you ask, how do i actually feel about the book? well.. i have many thoughts. as much as half of me wants to say “this is way too similar to his other books”, the other half of me wants to say “but even then, it’s still so damn good”. the way that he weaves sentences is absolutely legendary, and it’s like listening to a calming playlist in the middle of the night,  i feel. when everything around you is asleep and you are the only one awake, appreciating the words off the page like they’re fresh off the mind. honestly, going over a few more pages, that’s what it’s like. im reading a journal. entry with a little more continuity and less rambles, im watching a long cutscene draw out without any real words but it’s all spoken through feeling. to feel the same feel for two people at once is so interesting; i feel trapped within the walls of the book as i watch on the emotions and feelings they express.  
now that i’ve finished, it feels as if someone’s taken a piece of me and put it away in storage somewhere else for me to earn back later. i feel as if, again, i have lost someone or something, but not as much of a hole is there as i thought it would be. i feel a sense of relief, that the whirlwind is over, but also sadness, because i still want to have the adrenaline it gave me. it is like the feeling of getting knocked over by a strong wave, and loosing more and more of your energy each time you try and lift yourself up again. i want to feel, and to remember, the memory of writing this. i almost become locked in my own echo-chamber of relating things in the real world into the book. these memories of what i love will soon dissipate, and you get that sense of longing, of being alone— although that feeling is more evident in sputnik sweetheart than it is here. i mean, just damn, man.",books,4,1684725652.0,0.7

The Sunken Land Begins to Rise Again - M. John Harrison,"Just wondering if anyone else had read this since I feel the need to discuss it.

If I had to classify it I would put this book under the banner of weird fiction or perhaps magical realism. But I think it stands apart from magical realism compared to the usual Marquez and Rushdie reference points where rather than the magic and the real being intertwined quite naturally within the narrative, the magic is like a tumor in the middle of an otherwise realistic story and just sits there unavoidable but also unknowable.

The whole book feels like a dream thats just on the edge of being a nightmare. To use a strained metaphor: it feels like going to a pub in an area far away from home, you know how pubs work you can sit and have a pint, but also you know you don't belong there and there is something very integral about the place that you will never understand.

As you can see I barely even know how to talk about this book haha. I would recommend it with significant caveats, it's one of the most unique reading experiences I've ever had but I don't know if I'll ever want to read it again.

5/5 if anyone has recommendations from the same author it would be much appreciated.",books,13,1684682905.0,0.93

Personally I didn’t like it, I think that the build up for the “murder” was way to drawn out. It was obviously an accident and not Zoe’s fault.

Also what’s her age? I really have no idea because sometimes it sounds like she’s 12 and sometimes 17!!! (Just googled and turned out she was 15 makes some kind of sense ig)

I understand that her mother was traumatized from when she had a job about Dot’s accident but the way she fought with the dad about him loosing his job and so on really annoyed me. 

Max’s mom was also really annoying. Zoe expressed multiple times that she didn’t like to talk about Maxs death but she still tried to push her. I guess she was the only one she could talk to since Aaron went away. Which also pisses me off!!! He just left Zoe and his mom when they both needed him! 

What’s this book supposed to be sad? The only thing that made me a little bit sad was that last letter that Stuart didn’t get. (Also, I would to know that he read her letters and maybe responded to at least one!)

'Living with Our Dead' became a huge success in France, even though its main subject is anything but light... Brilliant reform female rabbi Delphine Horvilleur of Paris wanted to write a book about death for a long time, following the many funerals she officiated over the years and the stories and questions each one of them brought along. But she kept putting the idea off... Until the new reality of the corona pandemic, with death and the fear of death present in everyone's everyday life, caused her to sit down and write it.

The Sound and the Fury,"I'm about 50 pages away from finishing it, i hope to complete it tonight. 

It's a remarkable book, but boy is it confusing. At some point you need to stop trying to understand it and just let the effect take you where it's going to take you.

I read almost the entire Quentin section in a day, which is quite rare for me. It brought me back to a lot that has happened in my own life: my troubled relationship with my father, trying to break free from his nihilism, feeling like the only person in the world who's trying to do good and being tortured for it. The last 5 pages of his section messed me up. The way it's written so that his frantic thoughts build up rapidly as it becomes clear he has resolved to commit suicide. How the entire chapter, as he dwells on the peacefulness of the water, and the sinking flat irons, doing his last deeds on Earth, and it dawns on you the entire day he has been taking steps towards death. 

I usually roll my eyes at trigger warnings and stuff like that, but if you've come close to ending it, and you come from a family of suicide and decay, make sure you're in a good place before reading this. I sat in my house silently for a couple hours after his chapter ended. 

One thing i don't get is why the appendix that gives a biography for each family member celebrates Jason. Jason is a selfish, evil S.O.B. that corrupts everything he touches, yet the appendix venerates him like a hero.

For me it’s in The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown. There’s a scene where the bad guy breaks into a lab, and chases a side character woman through the dark, in a pitch black room, but the light of her phone and the sound of her footsteps.

"Treading on dark waters: Koji Suzuki's ""Dark Water"".","Finished up another of Koji Suzuki's works, the short story collection ""Dark Water"". This collection has at least about seven stories in total and is done in a way similar to a fix-up, as it has both an prologue and an epilogue.

With ""Dark Water"" as its title it is no secret that the theme that permeates most within the stories is water. Not only that the stories also have themes of horror both supernatural and real. And sometimes a mix of both.

Like with his first installment of his Ring trilogy the short stories presented are real serious slow burners. Stories that really get under your skin like any good horror. And also (I should've mentioned this before) the inclusion of Japanese traditions and superstitions that also appear in some of the stories.

Of course given the immense success that ""Ring"" had achieved it was inevitable that ""Dark Water"" would get a film adaptation (to some extent), well one of the stories from it actually. The story in question was in fact ""Floating Water"".

But overall this a very good collection from Suzuki. I especially like three of the seven stories which is going to include ""Floating Water"" (of course), ""Solitary Isle"" and ""Adrift"".",books,9,1684643773.0,0.8
"On The Road, Jack Kerouac. Thoughts?","I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this classic. I read it right after reading and Mystery-Thriller,  so the almost journalistic reporting/log entries style of the book, combined with the constantly changing locations and characters, with no clear climax made me interpret the book as sort of un-linear. I thought the book was kind of scatter-brained, but i still kind of enjoyed parts of it. I could not really picture some of the characters. I figured, even old beatniks back then wouldn't even speak like that. All that being said, there were a few chapters i thought were really cool, like \*SPOILER\* when the boys stole from the Army barracks/ outposts. Also, when they get hired to drive a car to a city (i forget, it's been a few months since i read it) and they kind of end up screwing the car up, that really cracked me up. I did end up enjoying the book, especially once i realized the story wasn't supposed to be as linear as conventional fiction, and also it was loosely based on experiences from when he was a young man living the beatnik, nomadic sort of lifestyle. Anyways, I've been curious what others have thought of this book.",books,20,1684619736.0,0.81
How do you mark your books as owned by you?,"I hate writing in books, it feels like graffiti to me. Whenever I'm reading something and taking notes, I'll buy a moleskin journal to shelve next to the book I'm reading, but I never ever never write in them.

I wanted to start labelling my books as owned by me. I know people will write their name on the inside cover, and I've seen monogram stamps etc etc.

I recently started the daunting task of cataloguing my books and want to find some way of marking inside the cover (specifically for book lending purposes) and am leaning toward printing off a form of ""library card"" to put in a sleeve.

Marx Watanabe is such a good person. There are so many moments in the book where I feel like he does everything without caring for any of the indifference and even hostility he experiences. It feels like he is just a good person through and through and never really gets the appreciation for it from Sam or even Sadie for most of the book. I get that he has been in the least problematic situation between most oft he characters in this book but that should not disqualify his efforts to be a good friend.  
Many times during the book I found myself thinking his handling of certain situations was very good and unusual for any person or ""unflawed"" character in fiction.  
I don't want to get into any details for anybody who doesn't want to be spoiled, but I feel like we should all strive to be so considerate and unapologetically supportive like Marx Watanabe in this.

Death By Landscape by Elvia Wilk was a thought provoking and enjoyable read.,Just finished this essay book. It read almost like a literature review but more in the way that it was organized.

Parable of the Sower and America in the '70s/'80s/'90s.,"So, I'm currently reading Parable of the Sower and thinking of how well it parallels the 2020s. It's even set 2024 onwards. I know many sci-fi books appear to predict the future when in actuality they are building on things that are happening just as the book is written. Handmaid's Tale is an example where it's fairly obvious that Margaret Atwood is criticizing the treatment of women in the real world by creating a fictional place. Ursula Le Guin's work is another example- The Dispossessed is a very accurate criticism of capitalism. And of course, 1984.

This makes me wonder what was happening in America in the 70s/80s/ 90s that is paralleled in the book which was published in 1993? What of it was already true? Were certain draconian laws passed, or labour laws abolished, or an unprecedented increase in the  crime rate, or something else? Or was she perhaps inspired by things that had happened throughout American history but nothing in that particular moment? I mean, I understand that it doesn't take much to imagine America like that, especially if you grew up during segregation, but I was wondering what specific things, if any, were happening in America in the 70s/80s/90s that could have served as a blueprint. 

Tldr: What horrible things in Parable of the Sower were already somewhat true in 70s-90s, if any?",books,9,1684606139.0,0.74

Do you prefer books with a large or small cast of characters?,"In the author's note in Under The Dome, Stephen King says why he didn't finish writing it in 1976, and writes:

'I was overwhelmed not by the large cast of characters - I like novels with generous populations - but by the technical problems the story presented, especially the ecological and meteorological consequences of the Dome.'

This made me realise that I don't really get along with novels that have lots of characters. Most of my favorite books ever have barely any characters.

Pet Sematary - 5 or 6

Misery - 2

I read Blood Meridian recently and that had a lot of main characters, but due to the rather odd writing style of the book most of the named characters never show up again and therefore aren't really much worth worrying about.

The main issue I have is that with novels with large populations... I just end up forgetting who everyone is. I remember near the end of Needful Things, there was a scene that I'm pretty sure was meant to be super dramatic and emotional, but it was hampered slightly by the fact that I literally couldn't remember who the main character in the scene *was* for most of it.

Love-Hate Relationship with Upton Sinclair’s Novels Oil! and The Jungle,"TL;DR: The Jungle and Oil! are excellent glimpses into Gilded Age and Jazz Age America, but the writing is so different from others of the time in both good and bad ways. 

I just finished reading his book *Oil!*, which I cannot recommend enough. While most people are familiar with the movie There Will be Blood, which is amazing in its own right, the plot only covers the first few chapters and really only loosely borrows the setting and character names.  J. Arnold Ross actually remains a loving, if corrupt businessman, father toward his son bunny even up to his death at the end of the book. Bunny not only does NOT go deaf, but the book focuses entirely on him and the confusion that youth brings upon going out into the world and being confronted with conflicting ideologies and opposing loyalties. 

The depiction of California from 1900s-1927, roughly, shapes it to be a sort of West Coast Great Gatsby in its depiction of the wealthy elite contrasted with the rest of society, with a notable lack of any symbolism whatsoever. It more than has its fair share of subtle wit and sarcasm that Sinclair seems to enjoy. Most of all, it seems history does not mention much of the Teapot Dome Scandal, the allied intervention and Czech brigade in the Russian Civil War, and the first red scare in the US. 

The book is absolutely a product of its time in many ways, especially with its inability to foresee the rise of Stalinism and New Deal Politics, as well as a fairly racist comparison of Jazz music to the drum beats of the Congo. Despite this, it is refreshing to see the struggles of the time with socialism, communism, and post-war frenzy that isn’t centered around the typical European or East Coast setting we see in Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and their peers and friends. I would not go as far to say it is better in any way, but certainly different. 

Having read The Jungle previously, I noticed both have an amazing storyline and characters that cover abject poverty and great wealth in the US of their time. Sinclair’s love of socialism is of course the driving point of each, but where The Jungle failed to give a satisfying end that did not feel preachy, I felt Oil! managed to just barely circumvent it with a fairly bleak ending tinged with a small ray of hope. In a sense, both endings also feel like they reflect the labor movements of their time and the endless struggle for equality in the US that they must have felt.

I Didn't Like To Kill a Mockingbird... At All,"
I'm a black girl in a majority white school and, like many people in America, had to read TKAM for my English class. 

Before reading it, I heard it get called THE book on racism towards black people, timeless, life changing, and a must read. Soo, I was pretty excited to read it and also see more people at my school become more understanding of issues in the black community. 

It was not that. 

It's crazy to me how this book is still praised in American school systems. The book focuses mainly on white characters, sympathizing with racists, ""looking past"" (not a quote from book) racism, and has black people take a backseat in their own history and fight. 

In my opinion it also diminishes the affect of other types of racism, verbal with the n* word, members of the lyn**ing party being called good people, and the k** being called ""nothing more than a political party""

I feel like it adds a barrier between THAT time and OUR time as a ""that was back then thing"" that allows people to ignore current issues.

Blood Meridian ~ thoughts,"This is my second reading and I found it even more impactful than the first. The disorientation I had felt was gone.  I knew what characters to focus on, I knew the setting, the rival parties, and the violence and bloodshed that lay ahead.  I was forced to focus instead of being at a more comfortable arm’s length.  

With all the horrible violence Blood Meridian is also full of beauty. 

“All night the wind blew and the fine dust set their teeth on edge. Sand in everything, grit in all they ate. In the morning a urinecolored sun rose blearily through panes of dust on a dim world and without feature. The animals were failing. They halted and made a dry camp without wood or water and the wretched ponies huddled and whimpered like dogs.”


“They halted in the dark to recruit the animals and some of the men stowed their arms in the wagons for fear of drawing lightning and a man named Hayward prayed for rain.”


Subtle things like “and a man named Hayward prayed for rain” makes this basic sentence stand out for reasons I can’t really describe.  Maybe it’s just a matter of flow and specificity. 

This is a magnificent work of art.  I don’t know that it’s my favorite of his works but it is undoubtedly his masterpiece.  


Written at a time when the two modes of thought were the superiority of the white man and the noble savage Blood Meridian obliterates both myths.  I don’t know that the book played any part in developing a more clear view of indigenous peoples and their relations with each other, Mexicans, and white settlers but it could have.  For that reason among many others I consider Blood Meridian one of the great American novels. 

Blood Meridian obliterates.  It obliterates our conception of our nature, the myths of our nation, our very soul. 


“Nothing moved in that high wilderness save the wind. They did not speak. They were men of another time for all that they bore christian names and they had lived all their lives in a wilderness as had their fathers before them. They'd learnt war by warring, the generations driven from the eastern shore across a continent, from the ashes at Gnadenhutten onto the prairies and across the outlet to the bloodlands of the west. If much in the world were mystery the limits of that world were not, for it was without measure or bound and there were contained within it creatures more horrible yet and men of other colors and beings which no man has looked upon and yet not alien none of it more than were their own hearts alien in them, whatever wilderness contained there and whatever beasts.”


From Wikipedia ~ 

The Gnadenhutten massacre, also known as the Moravian massacre, was the killing of 96 pacifist Moravian Christian Indians (primarily Lenape and Mohican) by U.S. militiamen from Pennsylvania, under the command of David Williamson, on March 8, 1782, at the Moravian missionary village of Gnadenhutten, Ohio Country, during the American Revolutionary War.

"Stoicism makes you happy: “A Field Guide to a Happy Life, 53 Brief Lessons for Living” by","Stoicism makes you happy. sorry for typo. i do it for myself. i just want to discuss about this book with you. 

Here is what seems useful to my life from a book called “A Field Guide to a Happy Life, 53 Brief Lessons for Living”. The author has written books about stoicism, and this book is about how stoicism makes you better person and happy.

\- An antidote for you feeling bad about yourself because you are poor: “being wealthy may be nice, but it does not make you a good person; being poor may be uncomfortable, but it doesn’t make you a bad person; or vice versa.”

\- Focus on what you can control like practicing, and don’t let the result affect your emotion because it is out of your control, rather let the process of practicing determine your overall satisfaction and your feeling.

\- Desire for what you can’t control and Aversion to loosing what you can’t control are  a major cause of your unhappiness.

\- When you have a desire for something or an aversion to something, pause, take a closer look and ask yourself “is this in my control?”

\- Train yourself to desire only what you can control.

\- “The development of your better self requires years of practice.”

\- Think this way: if you get a nice house, you think you are going to open it up to friends and neighbors or you are going to make it the nest of a thriving family. Only those things make you a good human being.

\- Anything happens to you is an opportunity to use virtues. For example, if you are tempted by lust, you will discover your ability for temperance. If you experience pain, you will find that you can practice endurance. If you are indulted by someone, you will use patience.

\- Don’t aim for externals that you can’t control such as impressing people.

\- When being insulted? you allowed people to insult you. Instead, think this way “what they say is just air moving between the two of you. “ and then take a break from the situation, put some distance between yourself and the immediate impression like feeling offended.

\- When setting a goal, consider reality of it. For example, “I want to compete in the Olympics as a runner.” Good for you. But do you have clear in mind what this means? You have to respect the rules, subject yourself to punishing exercise and a hard diet, rigorously follow the counsel of your trainer, abstain from certain pleasures, and so on. Then when the moment comes, you may injure yourself, you may fall on the course, or you may simply lose the race. Areyou okay with all of this?”

\- Be this kind of person.

\- Don’t talk too much; use some time to listen to others instead.

\- When you do speak express yourself well and concisely.

\- Don’t talk about other people behind their back, whether it is to blame them, praise them, or compare them to others.

\- Attempt to steer the conversation toward meaningful topics.

\- You always have the option to remain silent.

\- Do not indulge in luxuries. Try to adopt a rather minimalist style of life.

\- Do take care of your body, your health, and your safety.

\- Your reputation doesn’t change your quality. For example, “magine someone insists that the square root of nine is four. Is he wrong? Yes. Does that affect the reputation of the square root operation? No. The operation remains untouched, whereas the person who is in error comes across as a fool.”

\- Don’t judge people because you simply do not know enough about other people. For example, don’t say that someone drinks too much. Instead, you should say that someone is drinking.

\- You don’t know enough. Even Socrates said that he was not wise and didn’t know much.

Thoughts on The Metamorphosis,"I read Kafka's The Metamorphosis for the first time yesterday.  It's been a long time since a book made me feel so much in so few pages.

I know there are many different interpretations and I suppose what I felt immediately was fairly simplistic, but it spoke to realistic fears of mine of being trapped in my own body, unable to communicate or look after myself and being a burden to those around me, a situation where I am sure I would prefer death.  

At times I saw Gregor not as an inhuman creature, but as a real person afflicted by a terrible disease horrifying to his family, though they still know he is Gregor.  He is still mentally himself though slowly sinks into depression, the final straw being his sister's exclamation ""we have to try to get rid of it"", her dehumanisation and her rejection of him as her brother confirming that he is a burden to his family and allowing himself to die.  I can't say I wouldn't choose the same were I in Gregor's place.

Having thought about it overnight I have a small issue.  I think the immediacy of Gregor's death after Grete's outburst suggest that he would have died at this time anyway and is not ultimately a result of a form of suicide.  The injuries he has sustained and his starvation (although admittedly a result of his depression) would have resulted in his death on that night regardless.  If this is the case, has Gregor actually chosen death or would have he continued on, knowing how his family feel about the situation?

What are your thoughts?  Was Gregor's confirmation that he was a burden to his family enough to push him over the edge towards death or was it inevitable?

Throne of Glass is one of the worst books I’ve ever read,"With the most unrealistic and unbelievable main character I’ve ever encountered. She is an 18 year old assassin who startles at every sound, swoons over the crown prince (who she hated), eats candy to the point her teeth are stained, begs for a puppy, *sasses* everyone she can, and complains when she is woken up too early. 

There is no plot. There is no tension. The worldbuilding is boiler plate European fantasy. The love triangle is saccharine and predictable from the first page. 

What do people see in this book? I understand not every book needs to be *East of Eden*, but even the most egregious YA (*Hunger Games, Harry Potter*) were filled with breakneck pacing or charming creativity. 

Throne of Glass is insipid to the point of secondhand embarrassment. I’ve never been so frustrated reading a fantasy book. Please tell me I’m not alone.

Edit: The word “egregious” has triggered a lot of people when describing Hunger Games and HP. I only meant it in the sense that both HG and HP lean heavily on the tropes and storytelling conventions of YA genre fiction despite ostensibly having such wide appeal across demographics. 

It wasn’t meant as a legitimate criticism of either work, and maybe I should’ve been more precise in my language. I believe HP and HG are both examples of solid YA SFF.",books,4307,1684425210.0,0.86
What do you do if the book you're reading has a good premise but a terrible execution?,"The book im reading had a really cool premise. It's 60 Postcards by Rachael Chadwick. The main chacters mother passed away from cancer withing a couple weeks of being diagnosed at the age of 59. So to celebrate her mother, for her 60th birthday the main character goes to Paris and leaves 60 post cards around with a message and contact info and its about hearing the replys and whats becomes of this mission. 

Well, it sounds good but the writing feels really rushed. Also something 'funny' ALWAYS happens, it has very not like other girl vibes with all the ""what are the odds of THIS happening to ME?!"" or ""of course it happened to ME"". 

But I'm near the end. I though it would get better but no. I'm only 100 pages away and I want to quit bit I hate the idea of not finishing a book, its not satisfying to leave it!

There’s Just One Problem… by Brian Gewirtz,"I recently read *There's Just One Problem...: True Tales from the Former, One-Time, 7th Most Powerful Person in WWE* by Brian Gewirtz and absolutely loved it. I’m no die hard wrestling fan by any means; I only started casually watching about 4 years ago after meeting my boyfriend, who has been a lifelong fan. It is a niche book for sure-a lot of names and references would probably go over my head if I didn’t have basic wrestling knowledge. TBH, a lot still did, but it didn’t take anything away from the book or reading experience. I found Brian’s storytelling humorous, relatable, interesting, and at times, poignant. The backstage anecdotes and insights to the writing process were super fun to read about. I laughed out loud constantly throughout the entire book, which is not a common reading experience for me. All in all, I thought the book was a fantastic, entertaining read and would recommend to both casual and die hard wrestling fans. This has opened me up to the wrestling book world and I am planning on picking up one of Chris Jericho’s books next.

'You' fans should be just as angry at Netflix as The Witcher fans as they've murdered Caroline Kepnes' incredible books,"Just dipped into You season 4, while reading the fourth book, and bloody hell they've murdered Caroline Kepnes' babies.

Even though the show is wildly successful and this no doubt elevates Kepnes' book sales massively, I can imagine she must be slightly pissed over the fact the less talented show writers not only completely detached the plots from her great books - but also boiled them down to the lowest common denominators

I feel like the You books get an unfair rap due to the fact the Netflix show has devolved into a mindless campy 'popcorn fun' show - Dexter-lite with all sorts of hijinx. 

Like Jesus, the fourth season has Joe in London as a professor surrounded by complete caricatures of uber-obnoxious people - the writing is just so bad and on the noes. 

Spoiler for first episode: Inexplicably, a dead body is planted in his insanely expensive flat. He then proceeds break into some kind of factory while the worker conveniently nips out to catch the second half of a football match (45 mins). Then he cuts the body up and cleans the warehouse up in that limited space of time - in a montage with playful music. Then the actual killer is texting him etc. It's just beyond ridiculous.  There's also a moment where he swipes a necklace from one of his ex-flings  like he's suddenly some sort of master street thief.

Kepnes' books remain far more grounded, yet epic in scale (I realise how oxymoronical that sounds) and are a stream of consciousness from our maniacal, obsessed and pithy protagonist Joe.

 The books are really well written, in such a fresh style (mostly second person). Yes, there are  heightened elements, but it all makes sense in the context of this character's journey - which I would argue is richer and much more imaginative than the show's ongoing plotline. 

The books are also very self- aware and full of satire. From Joe's pithy remarks to even a couple of meta moments. There's one instance Kepnes even pokes fun at herself for always having Joe 'fall in love with the same girl', which also makes sense on a character level. 

In each book, Joe is surrounded by normal shallow people and he gets obsessed with a girl who's bookish and pretty - your classic  privileged white girl. What makes each of the books so good is how Joe responds to this world and his gripping narration. It's the character which guides the crazy storylines with his meddling in people's lives, not the other way around.

Plus, the character of Joe is different in Kepnes' books. He's far more intelligent, funnier with more of an arrogant, psychotic disposition while still retaining that faux-white saviour twisted moral compass where he thinks he's a good guy - or is atleast trying to be. You can't help rooting for him, even though he is a serial killer.

In the books, Joe also evolves as a killer with more sophisticated methods of getting away with his crimes. Plus, actions from previous books come back to haunt him.

The direction Kepnes has gone with the character in the books is just better. Far more creative. 

Season 1 of the Netflix show was very close to the books - really well done. It's without doubt the most memorable season of the show. I think that speaks volumes.

Season 2 retained general plot elements and character names of second book Hidden Bodies. But it did its own thing and made it far more campy. I have to admit that I enjoyed it - while noticing signs the show was devolving into a sillier soap opera version with slasher elements.

Season 3 then completely broke away from the books. He started a life with Love in suburbia and the show leaned heavily on the 'oh, isn't suburbia hellish' themes - quite predictable. I found it an utter slog to get through.

Season 4, as mentioned, I've seen the beginning of and it's painfully bad.

In comparison,  the third book You Love Me has Joe looking to start his own family in a different way. He preys after a married woman with a teenage daughter and plots to take out the husband - who he absolutely despises. The things Joe does and how crazy the plotline gets is levels above what they did in the Netflix show. With every chapter, I couldn't help thinking how much of a better TV show the story would have made.

In the fourth book For You and Only You, Joe is a fellow at Harvard University in a writer's group. He's once again surrounded by a mix of shallow people. But the characters feel more grounded and the world is so much more plausible (than what I have seen of Season 4). It provides a searing commentary on modern literature to a few winks and nods to Kepnes' own style.


Anyway, as you can tell, I'm slightly pissed about this haha. If you like the show, I implore you to give either the books or audiobooks a whirl - I'm pretty sure most would agree with me.

 (Side note: I've been listening to the audiobooks, Santino Fontana IS Joe Golberg - Penn Badgely has got nothing on him, highly recommend them just for Fontana's performance. Really elevates the books.)

I'm just surprised there isn't more backlash from the fans over the way the show has devolved. Just like how Netflix screwed with The Witcher. And to a lesser degree, how the Game of Thrones writers bungled A Song of Ice and Fire.

Are there any other You fans who agree with me?

Qualityland by Marc-Uwe Kling: what are your thoughts?,"I’m new to this subreddit but I just felt like I needed to share this. I really enjoyed Qualityland! This book did an amazing job of providing satirical commentary on our current dependence and battles with AI and consumer convenience with the perfect blend of humor. I know there is a sequel already written in Kling’s native German, but I really hope it is translated to English soon. 

What is everyone else’s opinion of the book?",books,13,1684515567.0,0.76
I hate that the general summary gives away the mystery of The Three Body Problem.,"If you haven't read the book or series, recommend skipping this first part. For those who don't mind ""spoilers"" or are already in the know, the following is the summary on one of the first pages of the book:

>!Set against the backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution, a secret military project sends signals into space to establish contact with aliens. An alien civilization on the brink of destruction captures the signal and plans to invade Earth. Meanwhile, on Earth, different camps start forming, planning to either welcome the superior beings and help them take over a world seen as corrupt, or to fight against the invasion.!<

This drives me absolutely nuts. While I recognize (and quite enjoyed) where the trilogy goes with the concept, the first book is essentially a sci-fi mystery novel. A mystery that was solved and given away to us as readers before we even got a chance to figure it out ourselves. I don't know if it was added in only English versions, but it's also what pops up on Google results. When I refer this series to people, I actively tell them to *NOT* look up info on it and instead give the following:

""Three Body Problem is a mystery that follows two perspectives, one of the past and one of the present.

First it follows Ye Wenjie, a woman who survived the Chinese Cultural Revolution, in the '60s. After all the hardships she faced in life, she is given an opportunity to change humanity forever. 

50 years later a professor, Wang Miao, is brought in to help an investigation to figure out why scientists around the world are killing themselves. The latest victim leaving behind a cryptic message, ""The Laws of Physics are a lie.""""

So yeah. That would be my pitch to help preserve future readers. If you skipped the spoiler section and only read my input, I hope you are interested. The rest of the trilogy builds off what takes places (obviously?), but, again, I just got so frustrated that it is all given away immediately.

Podcasts similar to 'If Books Could Kill'?,"I read a bunch of non-fiction, and recently came across *If Books Could Kill* podcast after seeing it mentioned here a bunch of times.

What's the point of Infinite jest?,"So I have just began reading infinite jest (am around 50 pages in) and I have heard that it's one of those difficult books and all but, until the moment, nothing much happened. 

I have no problem with books without a plot per se, but I really want to know what's the author's intention here. Is it symbolism? Is it a surreal Avant Garde kind of work? What should I expect? Because this thing is almost 1000 pages long and I don't want to commit without at least having some idea of the subject.

I know it works with the theme of drugs, which itself is a theme I don't care much about because of how pedantic the authors sound majority of time when writing about that (it's a impression of mine), so I'm also worried if the entire book won't be just David Foster Wallace patting himself on the back about how intelligent he is. Would that be the case?

The writing isn't difficult and I feel I can read the entire thing relatively fast, but I have the sensation that reading it fast will make me lost a lot of important aspects of it. Should I treat it like literary fiction or something more commercial? 

Anyway, I would appreciate any comment from the people that already read Infinite jest, or maybe that tried but didn't enjoyed. If you liked or didn't like it, why?

You guys can give as much spoiler you want, I don't care about spoiler at all as long as I enjoy the book.",books,5,1684515908.0,0.59

Re-reading Speaker for the Dead got me thinking about how some of the most beautiful writing can be written by truly hateful people. OSC is quite the homophobe, and I find it completely bloody mind-blowing to consider the work with the author. 


Of course, death of the author isn't anything new (yes I'm looking at you, JKR), but the names that come up tend to be the same over and over. 

It's not just the same controversial authors I'm interested in, it's the ones who have novels that can be read in such a way that they completely contradict their own beliefs. 
I'm not just being petty, either - it's completely fascinating to read a book that can be read in two completely different ways, depending on your personal perspective

OSC was my example, not just because he's a complete ghoul, but because his books are quite literally about how we (mis)understand one another, and how ignorance fuels violence. 
Knowing his views has let me read his books in a completely new way, and I've not thought so critically about a book in forever.

Earth seed series is not good,"I don’t understand why I’m not seeing this opinion more but let me spell it out cause I feel insane. Spoilers all over this post.

These books are actually bad like really really bad. A lot of what’s in this book is unnecessary or erroneous to the plot. 

1: Lauren is a theocratic monster. She forces her religion on everyone constantly. Within the acorn community people do not have voting rights unless they join the religion (this is a big deal and very manipulative) and the second book hints that this is maintained. She constantly thrusts her beliefs on people to a point where she interrupts her brother (while he is talking about being pimped out by 3 separate pimps, burned, and tortured) to push her beliefs on him. She is single minded and selfish AF about earth seed.

2: the books are written to sound like the author just hates addicts. The addicts in the books are addicted to a drug that makes them set fires and the addicts claim they use the fires against the rich… which they don’t. The synopsis of addicts is “they are monsters who destroy everything in their path and lie about it… addicts are bad” this plot line is disingenuous to addicts and class solidarity. Ultimately it’s a pointless plot line that adds NOTHING to the book. As many things in this series does. 

3: Lauren’s whole religion is based on change! God is change! Ect ect but she just does exactly what she criticized her father for doing at the beginning of the book. It’s almost a parody how useless most of the plot line is. 

4: Lauren believes that the solution to earths climate and capitalist crisis is space travel… the biggest criticism I could ever give these books is that I bet Elon Musk would love them. Lauren would have been an Elon Stan. I hate her so much. At least Ursula le guin had vision for the travel. 

5: clearly celebrating the grooming of a 17 year old girl by a 45 year old man… again this doesn’t need be even be in the book. 

6: her daughter is a brat… like sorry your uncle is a selfish piece of sh…… but that’s not your moms fault but also your mom sucks so idk good luck. 

7: generally the author seems to poorly understand class solidarity, addiction and problematic indoctrination. It’s bothersome that people celebrate Lauren because she is a religious monster and it’s obviously a grotesque problem even with the theocratic Christofascism  thats destroying the world. 

Both of the books are aweful and I’m upset that this is a rare opinion.",books,0,1684541560.0,0.4

The Pillars of the Earth: started good and turned into silliness,"I started reading this book after hearing about it on here. I really enjoyed the beginning. It was a seemingly new take on medieval adventure. 

But it is turning into such a silly storyline that I can’t keep reading. 

The way the head monk runs into these political problems and just happens to outmaneuver his opponents in such an easy fashion has removed all sense of immersion for me. 

They are tying to use the quarry but are blocked by armed guards. So all the monks sneak in at night, set up on the scaffolding, and start praying in the morning when the guards wake up? It seemed so corny I couldn’t help but laugh. 

And then, oh no, the bishop is coming and will see we are behind schedule with building the new cathedral. I know! Let’s invite everyone, put them to work, and when the bishop shows up he’ll see all this commotion and be happy. But wait, what if people don’t show? Our head monk is so nervous, but trusts in god. Day of the visit, only a few people show up and the monk is sad. But wait! Come look head monk! Then he goes up and sees thousands of people marching towards his cathedral to help.

So many of the characters and stories felt so real; and before reading it I didn't know that DFW deleted his map and had addiction problems; it's no wonder the book felt so intense and deep at times.

"In my early 20s, I didn't read fiction books because they weren't real, so I thought they were a waste of time. Nonfiction was my primary choice.","In my early 20s, I didn't read fiction books because they weren't real, so I thought they were a waste of time. Nonfiction was my primary choice.However, as time went by, I picked up a fiction book and reconsidered my stance. It wasn't a waste of time after all. Fiction can teach us something by telling a story.the scenarios and characters might not be real in the literal sense, but the emotions, life lessons, and human experiences they conveyed were very much real and relatable. I came to understand that fiction, through its carefully woven narratives and compelling characters, could also teach us something profound about life, ethics, philosophy,science, histoty, society, and the human condition.

What is a book you think everyone needs to read at least once in their life?,"For me, it's Candide by Voltaire because it offers a timeless and thought provoking perspective on the human condition, society, and the pursuit of happiness.

Why you should never read The Maid by Nita Prose,"I love reading suspense thrillers and mystery novels. I judged The Maid by its clean cover and expected a good storyline before I picked the book. Unfortunately, I picked this book purely out of impulse without checking any reviews.

The Maid has one of the most boring storylines of all time. For a book that proclaims it should fit in the ""suspense thriller"" category, I could hardly find any twist. 

The first 170 pages in this book are total BS and don't help in any way to how the story proceeds later. The author presents us the protagonist as somebody who's weird, but that doesn't move the character. The character simply is not likeable till the very end.

So why did I read this book fully, you may ask. The reason is because, I still expected a major twist or a break point till the very end. The author moved the story in such a way that you can probably expect something off beat in the end, but it's very disappointing to not see any of that. It's a very very generic story line and anybody would guess how it's going to go.

Do yourself a favour by not purchasing this book. In case you've already bought, leave it as such and don't read. It's okay.",books,0,1684466854.0,0.47
Learning to appreciate the free things: The best return on (reading) investment you can make,"I've recently had a fascination in books on understanding nature and natural processes to appreciate their intricacies, especially the kinds that surround us in day to day life. The impact on the 10% of happiness made up of wonder and awe has been significant, and I wanted to share some. Please let me know of any books that you think fit this kind of idea!

&#x200B;

**The Cloudspotter's Guide (Gavin Pretor-Pinney):** A fantastic read going through all the kinds of clouds that exist, how to spot which is which, why they form that way etc. Filled with a healthy mix of science and prose in adoration of the clouds throughout the span of written history, this book takes the cake for the most bang for your buck. Each chapter will lift your spirits when you next see *that* cloudform sometime soon. In the author's words, ""Clouds are Nature's poetry, and the most egalitarian of her displays, since everyone can have a fantastic view of them."" You'll never look up the same way again.

**Sounds Wild and Broken (David George Haskell):** Incredibly well researched, a surprisingly long but comfy read for a day or two about all things sonic in nature. Spans the globe in its reach, and probably the least applicable to daily appreciation of this list, but opens your ears none the less. Full of crazy examples throughout nature of where sound and noise find their purpose, such as frogs that give mating calls almost to their death just to prove how strong they are (Spring Peepers).

**The Hidden Life of Trees (Peter Wohlleben):** A modern classic, already wildly popular, and likely many people's first foray into a better understanding of the natural world through popular science books. And for good reason too, again an example of both beautiful description balancing scientific explanation of what lies under the radar for most of us. Gives a deeper connection to the interconnectedness of any relatively untouched patch of flora.

**The Overstory (Richard Powers):** The only fiction I'll provide here, but my first step into appreciating nature. Beautiful stories woven together in praise of the tree and its majesty. Left me acutely aware of just how much the trees have ""won"" evolution already in many ways, and we just happen to exist in their world.

**Breath (James Nestor):** All about breathing! Doesn't get more free than that, full of interesting journeys into different realms of fitness, mindfulness, healing etc. I think it does a good job of not trying to be an authoritative source on the subject, but a great eye opener none the less, with some fun exercises to try at the end. I'd be surprised if at least some of the stories didn't blow your mind, either the surprising *increase* in athletic function to be gained by jut breathing through your nose, and the upper limits of some yogis/masters and their control of the body through breath.

Fritz Lieber’s Our lady of Darkness and the scholars mistress,"Years ago I read Our lady of darkness when I was a ferocious reader(now a day I just read maybe a book every few months) and something always stuck with me from it. 
The main character has a pile of books that he pick’s from that he keeps not by his bedside table but ON the bed itself. He sleeping next to bunch of books, all of which he read’s pretty much at the same time. He refers to that bunch of books on his bed as “the scholars mistress”. When I was an avid reader I did indeed have a bunch of books that was what I was reading at the time on my actual bed a ever since I called it “the scholars mistress”.

I don’t know how the author does it, but she draws me in so completely. I read Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell about a decade ago, and that was amazing as well, but Piranesi is shorter and so completely great.

How she did not lose hope once throughout the novel, how she remained true to her morals, how she accomplished far more than wealthy women accomplished in those days. 

It is safe to say Jane is one of my favourite heroines. 

My favourite scene was when Jane leaves Thornfield and becomes totally destitute and penniless but still somehow finds her way and even ends up becoming very rich. 

 I have a question though: John Rivers asked Jane to marry him but I thought it was forbidden for Christians to marry their cousins? John was religious and so was Jane but cousin marriage part really confused me because I had thought that it’s a cardinal sin in Christianity.

What hook from a books first sentence that has completely reeled you in?,"Mine is 'The madness of an autumn prairie cold front coming through. You could feel it: something terrible was going to happen.' The Corrections by Jonathan Franzen.

Not my favorite hook but I liked the book a lot. I thought it was very well-written and engaging. I liked how Franzen explored the different perspectives and motivations of each of the characters. I also liked how he mixed humor and drama, and how he addressed some of the important issues of our time.I disliked some of the characters, though.  (Spoiler)>! I thought they were selfish and irresponsible. For example, I didn’t like how Chip wasted his talent and betrayed his girlfriend. I also didn’t like how Gary let his wife dominate him and how he treated his father. I also didn’t like how Denise cheated on her partners and hurt them.I thought the actions of the main character, Alfred, were sad and tragic. He was a proud and intelligent man who had worked hard all his life, but he ended up losing his mind and dignity. He was also isolated and misunderstood by his family. He had a lot of regrets and secrets that haunted him. I felt sorry for him and wished he could have had a better life.  !<

Overall, I think the book was very realistic and relatable. It showed how families can be dysfunctional and unhappy, but also how they can love and support each other. It also showed how people can make mistakes and try to correct them. It was a book that made me think and feel a lot. I would recommend it to anyone who likes novels that are deep and meaningful.

Thank you to all the authors writing educational books,"I love to read! I love to read fiction to relax and escape, but that is not what I want to talk about - I want to talk about how much I value educational books.

I have used books to learn about many different topics, often to an advanced level. I have realised that when it comes to self guided learning, especially at more advanced levels, books are the most important useful tool for learning and improving.

Here are just a few of the best educational books which I have read, that have helped me to learn a huge variety of different topics:

* Guitar playing: The Principles of Correct Practice for Guitar - Jamie Andreas
* Networking for software engineers: High Performance Browser Networking - Ilya Grigorik
* JavaScript: You Don't Know JS - Kyle Simpson
* Gardening: The New Self Sufficient Gardener - John Seymour

I do a lot of research to find books that are well written, authored by an expert, and whose voice resonates with me. Usually I try and find excerpts online to make sure that the book is for me. 

What is not written in these books is as important as what is written. When learning from other sources such as online material or a mentor, I often end up getting confused about what I should be focusing on, what the key concepts and ideas are, which details are critical and which areas are irrelevant. When I read a good book I feel like the signposts for what I need to do or understand are all there, and I rapidly form a neat map of all relevant information in my mind. I usually finish the book feeling like I know more about the topic than 99% of people, despite it only taking a month or so of reading a little each day.

Online articles, videos and courses can't compare. Not that they are useless - for me they tend to be good for an introduction, a practical example, or a reminder of what I learned from a book. I think part of the reason for this is that publishing a book has a high barrier to entry in terms of time and financial investment, and out of the books which are published only the most popular ones with the best reviews stay in circulation.

I'm really grateful for the experts that write these kind of books, as they are responsible for my understanding of the world around me, my mad skillz, and also much of my career success. It seems to be at least in part a labour of love to write this type of book, as while the author may improve their reputation and make a lot of money, it is far from guaranteed.",books,40,1684333589.0,0.94

Late: Just finished The handmaid’s Tale,"I read The Testaments first lol and finally gave a crack at The Handmaid’s Tale. I did watch the show 3 season in and finished the last 2 after finishing the books. 

first Id like to say how happy I was to see direct quotes from the book in the show. I could easily see events and such and that was a great connection to have. 

Now, the book. I really didn’t like it and I wish I did. I honestly think Margaret Atwood’s writing isn’t for me. I found myself falling asleep several times due to the consistent and dragged out descriptions in every chapter. I felt like there was so much description (which I understood for the most part) but at times I wish there was more about when the changes shifted or i guess the details that the show was able to incorporate and dramatize.

I have tickets to see a theatre performance of it in June and had started reading it the day I made the booking. Since I was determined to finish it in time, after I got stuck I set myself a schedule and it worked out to only be 10 pages a day. With that being so manageable, I picked it up again, and found myself wolfing it down, absolutely loving it, 10 pages was not enough.  

>!Considering I would have known of Anna's ending for as long as I had known about the book, I still found that shocking and moving to read. I found it interesting that Vronsky maintained perspective of how far their relationship had deteriorated even through his profound grief. I enjoyed following Levin's journey towards his form of enlightenment, albeit sort of rediscovering God rather than losing God. It feels like both characters followed their own will, and it just happened that one is ruined by that and the other has found contentment. Levin can hold the Meaning of Life and still be grumpy with everyone!!<

"Just finished The Power Broker by Robert Caro: It's nearly 1,200 pages, but I would've gladly read another 1,200.","This was the best book I have ever read.  Robert Caro, through painstaking research and interviews (including 7 with Robert Moses himself), has beautifully told the incredibly layered, complex, and spectacular (for better or worse) life and career of Robert Moses.  The way he writes is enthralling, engaging, and riveting.  There are times I remind myself that the events in this book ACTUALLY happened, which thus resulted in me being saddened (is with his destruction of Sunset Park or East Tremont) or elated (Nelson Rockefeller!!).  I swear this read like a fiction novel.

I finished the book in Washington Square Park (I live in Brooklyn), which I felt was one of the most fitting locations to finish it.  Afterwards I just sat there, looking at the fountain, the arch, all the people congregating in every reach of this historical park (it is also graduation week at NYU so it was especially packed) and just contemplated what I read...everything Robert Moses built, everything he destroyed, the people who worked tirelessly to bring him down, and the final words of the book.

This wasn't only a biography.  It is a case study on absolute power, on how it's built, how it's wielded, and finally taken away.  About the people it's used on.  About the people who profit from it.  From the people who lose everything from it.  And the type of people who crave it.  Whether you live in NYC, NYS, or anywhere in the world, this is an incredibly important book.  Robert Caro deserves every praise in the world.

This book has absolutely impacted my life.  It has pulled back more layers on corruption and power than I even knew existed, and I will NEVER look at NYC, my home which I love so dearly, the same ever again.

What are your favourite works of fiction about your city?,"Lots of great books have been set in London, from a Tale of Two Cities to Mrs Dalloway to Swing Time but books about London in some sense are a narrower category. Recently I read Muriel Spark’s The Ballad of Peckham Rye which is a sort of supernatural story about a trickster from Scotland who moves to South London and basically torments the residents, it really balances the hilarious and the deeply horrific quite well and is a good critique of the situation of the London working class in the postwar era. It’s interesting because Ms Spark was in some sense a reactionary that the book is quite radical in spite of itself and appeals quite nicely to my own sensibilities as a communist, functioning as strongly exemplary of how the flaccid centrist liberalism of the postwar era served to sanitise, deradicalise and defang the culture and social dynamics of the British working class without actually bringing liberation or addressing the systemic oppression of the proletariat.

Spoilers - The Ferryman by Justin Cronin - just finished and want to discuss,"So i just finished reading The Ferryman and I totally enjoyed it. I liked the world building and all the characters.

I liked the layered themes -- mystery, sci-fi, environmental doom, man acting like God, how worship and religion can develop, etc. Anyone want to discuss?

After finishing the book I was left questioning how they were able to wake up the colonists from stasis because it didn't seam like the randomization of the password problem was solved. Also, did Elise wake up and just stay in stasis, or was her just remembering enough to change the dream? And finally, if Proctor was able to step in as the Designer why didn't he do that initially?

"'France, Spain, and the Rif' by Walter B. Harris, a Forgotten Book, about a Forgotten War.","As of Now, this is the only review for this book on the internet (that I'm aware of), which is cool, but also a little sad. 'France, Spain, and the Rif' published in 1927 by Englishman Walter B. Harris, is the only book covering the Rif War (1921-1926) from all sides of the conflict. The book is also unique by nature of the fact that Harris was in Morocco during the conflict, and witnessed firsthand some of the events of this forgotten war.   
  
Harris does a decent job parsing through myth and reality, but there are definitely moments that his bias towards one of the participating nations is evident. Harris also struggles with cohesively sharing the story of this conflict in a chronological order, and he often gets lost in the weeds explaining unique, but generally useless information about the war itself. It's certainly not the pinnacle of history books, but 'France, Spain, and the Rif' does well enough for being the only book of its kind. If you enjoy learning about more obscure and relatively forgotten parts of history, something like this might be right up your alley. It's a longer book, and it can be difficult to keep reading at points, but if you want to learn more about the Rif War via book, this is your best bet. I learned much from reading this, and generally enjoyed the experience, so if history is a guilty pleasure, I'd recommend this book.

Titus Groan was amazing.,"I just finished reading Titus Groan. I am honestly so blown away by how much I enjoyed this book.

The book is very unique. It is a sort of gothic, slow fantasy taking place in a bizarre castle. The world-building is amazing. The castle is filled with all sorts of very unique characters with different quirks. I became very connected to Fuschia as the story progressed, I really liked her/was drawn to her for some reason haha. So, characterization was also amazing. And the prose is so beautiful! Such gorgeous flowing descriptions of everything. The little character inner monologues were so interesting to read as well. There were also some little bits of witty/interesting humour that made me snicker throughout the book.

For a while now, I had been looking for a book that is similar to the Gray House by Petrosyan. I honestly saw a lot of parallels between these two! I wouldnt be surprised if Titus Groan may have had some influence on The Gray House.

I'm excited to also read book 2 of the trilogy. 

For those who have read book 3 as well, I was wondering if it is worth the read too? I heard some mixed reviews about this one.

The Awakening by Kate Chopin - I could never resonate with Mrs. Pontellier, and I find her annoying and her decisions quite selfish all throughout the book. But when I finished the book, I literally teared up. I could never think of the sea in the same way again.

By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept by Paulo Coelho - I disliked the religious imagery embedded in the book, and it was a good thing it was only 100+ pages long, or I would never have finished it. In this case, it was a more love-hate relationship because I absolutely loved the prose and resonated with the protagonist's introspections.

Does Dean Koontz think he's more clever than he really is?,"I'm currently reading Odd Opscalypse and I'm honestly having trouble reading it and not because it's a difficult read but because it feels like Koontz is trying to be too witty and clever but ultimately it just feels like a convoluted mess. I read and fell in love with Odd Thomas about 5 years ago and made the mistake of reading Forever Odd and Odd Brother back to back. As much as I loved Odd Thomas the character all of his story are pretty much copy paste to the point where you know what's gonna happen and in the case of Odd Brother you guess who the ""villain"" is pretty early on only for Koontz who thinks he's so clever to straight up tell you ""no it's not him"" only to later reveal to the reader that hey ""it really is him got you!"". Now I'm not sure if Koontz writing changed for Odd Opscalypse or if I'm just misremembering the earlier Odd books but it didn't seem like Koontz was trying to be this clever. Odd is a simple character and his stories felt like a simple man getting caught up in extraordinary situations but now it feels like his world had to be extraordinary also and it makes for a bad time reading. At least for me.

This is how you lose the time was is incredible,I love it so so much. Its such a beautiful love story in the form of a romantic scifi epistolary novella. It only takes a few hours to read but i think the story will forever stick with me. I've read it twice already and am about to read it again instead of sleeping. It's a beautiful story. I don't want to spoil it at all. The plot twist isn't too hard to guess but it was well executed and while the ending was maybe slightly underwhelming it was probably the best ending for the story. I so highly recommend it and looking at amazon I'm not the only one who adores it considering its the highest rated scifi romance book sold on the site. I'm getting the Cybernetic tea shop tomorrow which is another romantic scifi and I'm also getting one other book maybe 2 if i can find an actually affordable copy. I might do a more indepth review but rn i just can't get the story out of my brain. Its so great. In 4 or 5 hours I'll probably have finished it if i don't sleep,books,4,1684331419.0,0.61

book shopping in another country is so fun!!!,"i live in the us and i’ve been wanting to read a few books, but where i live they’re only made in hardcover books. which i HATE. i don’t like reading hardcovers and ALSO i like all my books to be paperbacks so they all match :) but anyway i’m out of the country right now and i stopped in a bookstore and WOW. it was amazing??? i found happy place and house of sky and breath in paperbacks !! and i found emily henry’s alternative covers as well as a bunch of other alternative covers too. i had way too much fun in there and i would have spent all of my money there if i didn’t have a weight limit on my suitcase </3 i know you can probably find them all online, but it was just so cool to see all of these books in person. now i’m going to have to try lasting the rest of my trip without going back to the bookstore!",books,45,1684275887.0,0.79
Finished TJR’s Malibu Rising & The Seven Husbands Of Evelyn Hugo,"I started reading them as a way to fully get back into reading, and enjoyed both! I wouldn’t be able to tell you which one I liked more, but Malibu Rising made me feel so many emotions. This is probably because I am a girl with older sisters who I’m very close to, and I could relate a lot to the Riva kids’ relationship and their feelings about Mick in some instances.

This isn’t to say that TSHOEH didn’t move me, I cried a little when Harry passed and the entire book was so compelling! Anything set in the 50s or 60s is immediately interesting to me. I somehow also predicted the final twist ( I was thinking about the possibilities a bit too hard while in class ), I wish I hadn’t lol.

Also, before reading the book I was expecting to not like Monique considering how others talked about her on the internet. But she was fine?? Like sure her chapters were less interesting, but she was just doing her job and her feelings towards Evelyn in the end were justified. I don’t know I could be wrong here 🤔

Thank you for letting me dump my thoughts here lol",books,0,1684346066.0,0.5

Do very successful writers become resistant to being edited?,"I just finished Christopher Paolini's book *To Sleep in a Sea of Stars*. I hadn't read him before, as my taste leans more toward science fiction than fantasy, but he's of course famous for *Eragon* and its sequels. *To Sleep in a Sea of Stars* wasn't bad, but it's about 900 pages long, and felt like it was a story of about half that length plus a whole ton of padding.

This got me to wondering whether a writer who's really successful can be difficult to edit. If it's early in their career and they aren't known yet, they have to listen when editors say to cut stuff that just lengthen a book without contributing much. But once a writer is really *big*, then maybe they can push back on editors who suggest cuts, and force the parts that feel like just padding to be left in.

What's your experience? I'd love to hear if you've read many books by one author across their career, whether their work got less tight over time and with more success. Or if you have counterexamples, where even as an author got popular, their published work still felt tightly edited, I'd love to hear those too.",books,67,1684253239.0,0.91

"Myanmar/burmese ""monk"" music?","Hi all,

a few years back I've been to Myanmar and we stayed in a hut with our guide where I was woken in the middle of the night with what I thought was some hard techno music from a nearby party or something.

Our guide then told us that in fact this was from a nearby monastery where the monks were celebrating something and played their drums and other instruments.

I've since tried to find this kind of music but my searches always only yield some random east asian techno music or even western remixes with some sampled chants.

I can't sing high notes.,"I can't sing high notes.

So, it all started when I hit puberty, voice started getting 'croaky' and cracking often.

When I was younger, I could sing very high notes, but for some reason, I can't now. If I try it feels as though if my voice hits a roof and can't go higher, my face squints and does this really awkward expression while having the most weird voice possible when trying to hit high notes,

It's as if, like scraping cardboard against spikey concrete, not to mention it often times hurt if I try to do so.

MOST of my family is disappointed so far, my voice has gotten deeper and has more bass but there's literally no progress on high notes.

It honestly makes me hate music, the only thing I WAS good at ruined by puberty.

I don't know how to fix this, i go to a music class where they train our voice.

I have improved my tone, my breath support and my dynamics but I plainly suck at high notes. When people there sing high notes I hate to admit it, I get jealous.

"[Playlist] I've spent the past 6 years refining 25 Spotify and Apple Music playlists so that I can take the aux in any scenario. With over 120 hours of music, I'm ready to share them with the world so that you can also take the aux whenever needed.","Hey /r/Music,

[A few years ago I posted my playlists to this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/kte31v/playlist_ive_spent_the_past_4_years_refining_25/), and I still get some comments  on that post, so I decided to post them so more people can see them, and hopefully be prepared whenever someone asks them to play some music!

Some of these playlists might have a couple of familiar songs, but I'm entirely confident that everyone will find some new music in every single playlist here. I won't give you any more filler than is necessary, just a quick explanation of the intended mood of each playlist - and its flagship songs.

***

I have spent years curating these playlists, taking out songs almost as fast as I add them to keep quality high. Somewhere along the way, I decided to collect all the songs that either didn't make the cut or didn't fit into any specific playlist. Thus, [Spare Sessions](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5DHoXJ6mMHVyaUgk6NgzDe?si=AzblnCblTfGCSq8ambsiEg) was born. This is an incredibly eclectic mix of music, recommended for only the very adventurous listener. 

As happy as I am with all of these playlists, none of them are (or ever will be) fully complete. I'll continue to add and remove songs from them in the future. So, if you have any song recommendations for any of these playlists I would love to hear them. Last note, I use Spotify so I will rarely update the Apple Music playlists, but I felt like sharing them since not everyone is on Spotify.

🔹 Crossbody bag: A stylish bag that hangs across your body, allowing you to keep your stuff secure while having the freedom to dance and groove. Do you dig a crossbody bag for festivals? What features would make it a must-have accessory?  
  
🔹 Sling bag: A versatile choice that hangs across your body and keeps your belongings secure while your hands are free to party. Are you a fan of sling bags at festivals? What features would make it the ultimate festival companion?  
  
🔹 Backpack: A reliable and spacious option for those who like to carry more gear. Perfect for all-day festivals or if you like to be prepared for anything. Have you used a backpack at festivals or concerts before? What features would make it the ultimate festival gear?  
  
But wait, there's more! I also want to understand your needs, preferences, and how you make decisions when buying bags. Help me out with these questions:  
  
🔹 Your needs: What are the most important factors for you when choosing a bag for music festivals? Is it durability, style, comfort, storage capacity, or something else entirely? Let me know what you prioritize!  
  
🔹 Preference and decision-making process: How do you usually decide which bag to buy? Do you rely on recommendations, online reviews, or personal experience? Is it an impulsive decision or do you carefully weigh your options? Share your process with me!  
  
🔹 Bag brands: Have you used any specific brands of bags before? Which ones did you find impressive or unsatisfactory? Knowing your experiences with different brands will help me create something truly outstanding.  
  
Your insights will shape the design, features, and overall experience of the bag I'm creating. So please, share your thoughts, opinions, and any experiences you've had with different bag brands.  
  
Let's make sure this bag stands out from the rest and becomes the must-have accessory for every music festival and concert-goer!

From an interview excerpt on this one by Billy, and this honestly makes a ton of sense, I think:   

Regarding the album's thematic content, Corgan would later say,

""The album is about pain and spiritual ascension. People ask if it's a political album. It's not a political album, it's a personal album. In a weird kind of way, Gish is almost like an instrumental album—it just happens to have singing on it, but the music overpowers the band in a lot of places. I was trying to say a lot of things I couldn't really say in kind of intangible, unspeakable ways, so I was capable of doing that with the music, but I don't think I was capable of doing it with words."" -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish

"Songs that gave a sense of that crime detective, brooding on a rainy night trying to come to grips with what they learned","One of my favorite songs is ""All was quiet"" from ""Alaskan Tapes"". In that song, there's a muted trumpet(?) playing. Two long notes, played repeatedly, a bit of variation thrown in. Low and high. From 2:35 in the song. It's what you might hear in older movies with the type of scene in the title. Sort of that cliche detective sound track.

I absolutely love this sound. It's incredibly relaxing. Does anyone know of songs similar in style to this that have that muted trumpet(?) sound? I would be eternally grateful.

If I make this EP and my voice sucks and it goes over terribly then I’ve wasted all these really cool songs, should I make it with the change of it being bad?

Can you be addicted to music?,"Hey there, fellow music enthusiasts! Today, I want to dive into a topic that resonates deeply with my soul: the beautiful addiction to music. If you're anything like me, you know the feeling of being completely consumed by the melodies, lyrics, and rhythms that surround you. It's as if the world fades away, leaving only you and the symphony of sound.  
  
For as long as I can remember, music has been an inseparable part of my life. From the moment I wake up until the time I drift off to sleep, my ears are constantly craving the next harmonious note to fill the air. It's not just a background noise or mere entertainment; it's an emotional journey that fuels my spirit and electrifies my existence.  
  
One might wonder, what is it about music that captivates us so intensely? It's a mystical force, capable of evoking emotions we didn't even know we had. It can transport us to distant memories or paint vibrant scenes within our minds. Music is a universal language that connects us all, crossing cultural boundaries and speaking to the depths of our souls.  
  
Every genre has its own unique flavor and charm. Whether it's the raw energy of rock, the soothing embrace of classical compositions, or the infectious beats of hip-hop, there's something out there for everyone. And I've made it my personal mission to explore the vast sonic landscape and discover hidden gems that resonate with my being.  
  
Being addicted to music doesn't mean simply listening to it all day long; it's about feeling it on a profound level. It's about those moments when a song hits you right in the heart, sending shivers down your spine. It's about dancing uncontrollably when the rhythm takes hold, losing yourself in a sea of euphoria. Music has the power to make us feel alive in ways nothing else can.  
  
Moreover, music has been a constant companion during both joyful and challenging times. It can uplift our spirits when we're feeling down, provide solace when we're seeking comfort, and give us the motivation to push through life's obstacles. It's an art form that speaks to our very essence, reminding us that we're not alone in this vast universe.  
  
Yet, with every addiction comes a responsibility to maintain balance - and im terrible at that.",Music,0,1685363969.0,0.38

From what I remember, the music consisted of chiptune and punk mixed together. Definitely from the 2000’s. It seemed like a solo artist that had like a karaoke machine or sequencer playing the backing tracks for him. Kinda like MySpace era diy music and the humor of the band was probably not very politically correct. I think the name of the project had his name in it? Like Kyle or nick or something.

A book title spawned three fantastic songs in different genres.,"The song ""Games People Play"" by The Spinners was #1 on the soul charts and crossed over, like many Spinners songs, to hit #5 on Billboard Hot 100 and is still a great listen.

The progressive rock song ""Games People Play"" by the Alan Parsons Project (vocals by Lenny Zakatek) hit #16 in the U.S. and holds up to this day.

The country song ""Games People Play"" by Joe South won Song of the Year in 1970, hit #12 on Billboard, was a huge international hit, and has been covered by dozens of country and rock stars over the years.

The phrase ""Games People Play"" was the title of a best-selling book by Dr. Eric Berne, one of the first books in the Pop Psych field that began in the 1950's and peaked in the 1970's.

The colors in the video where also really bright, as if the camera had an LSD effect.
Last scene in the video is the two protagonist holding hands while making their way to somekind of big owl thing, who appears to be standing on the edge of a forrest.

What's the best way to tackle a list of Albums,"So I'm currently working my way through the Rolling Stones Top 500 Albums list that's online. 

This is more of a way for me to try and broaden my music tastes, trying to get good albums from all genres and years etc. I have them all organized in an excel sheet, by rank, date and genre.

However what would you all recommend is the best way to go about it?

Should I go from 500-1?
Should I go from 1-500?
What about randomising the list and going through it then?
Should I go by artist? Or by year?

I know there's no wrong answer but to try and broaden my range of music, what is the best way to enjoy the music and not just getting through the list for the sake of it. To try and actually digest the music and remember it etc.

TL:DR: I have 500 albums to listen to. Should I listen to it in order, by genre, or by artist? Or another way.

"Walking Bass Academy, free App to learn how to walk the Bass!","Hello everyone!

I'm Noah Steiner, a 19-year-old bassist who is also passionate about app development. I've been playing bass and upright bass for the past 12 years, and throughout my journey, I've had some amazing experiences. Recently, I had the opportunity to participate in the Youth Forum for Computer Science and even made it to the second round of the National Computer Science Competition. Now, I'm eager to combine my love for music with my interest in technology to assist fellow bassists and myself.

Allow me to introduce the Walking Bass Academy app! This app aims to make learning walking bass lines an effortless process by providing exercises on chords, scales, and songs. Additionally, I have plans to incorporate a feedback system and launch an enjoyable learning campaign.

I have prepared a brief preview of the progress I've made in developing the app, which you can find on YouTube: [YouTube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy9rnJvWmQc]. I would greatly appreciate any feedback you have to offer.

Currently, the app is not available on the Play Store or App Store, as the combined fee of 125€ is quite substantial for me. However, if you're interested, please reach out to me, and I'll be more than happy to send you the APK file directly.",Music,21,1685258563.0,0.88

I was wondering if there was anyone out there who could give me tips on becoming a private voice lesson teacher?

 Also if you guys have any teaching tips or anything you could share it would be much appreciated!

"LPT: If you can't find the motivation to clean or declutter a big mess, just put one thing away and then go back to what you were doing","I've seen advice like this where the idea is that once you get started, you'll keep going and end up cleaning the whole room. If you end up cleaning more then great, but that's not the point of this advice.

What I'm suggesting is that, if you have some corner of your room where you've been accumulating junk, the next time you look at it and experience stress, just take one thing out of the pile and put it away and then go back to your video games or whatever you were doing before. If you're getting stressed out by a mess on your desk, just take one item that doesn't belong there and put it away. If you're frustrated by a mess in your kitchen, just throw away a handful of trash or put away one thing that doesn't need to be on the counter. You don't even have to do this once per day to reverse the direction of clutter accumulation.

It'll take a while to straighten up a whole room, but it'll be quicker than if you continue to avoid it entirely week after week. Even though the change will be slow and gradual, you'll always be getting that positive feeling when you walk into the room and see that it's a little cleaner than it was before. Prioritize putting away the largest item for the biggest visual improvement, or the thing that you've been stepping over or that has otherwise been getting in your way on a daily basis and you'll feel the reward every time you don't have to deal with that inconvenience.",LifeProTips,1571,1685378528.0,0.96

"LPT: Keep a ""Make my life better"" list.","So this is something that's worked for me. I've maintained the same google sheet for my entire life, for what I call my ""Make my life better"" list.

This isn't a todo list necessarily, just a list of all of the things that you'd like to accomplish that will make your life better. The idea is that you'll never finish this list. It will always grow and change. BUT if you focus on even doing one thing from this list a week, you'll continually make your life better. 

These are supposed to be in addition to your normal weekly tasks like cleaning and laundry. Here are some example ideas:

1. Organize the garage
2. Research scholarships for next year
3. Backpacking plan for August

You can even take this a step further and keep multiple lists like I do. I have the following lists:

1. Top priority (Money and Health Related. Also tasks with a deadline like buying a fathers day gift)

2. Normal tasks. 

3. Big long term projects. (Like building a fence). These normally are expensive and I'm lucky to accomplish 1 a year. 

Thats it. Nothing radical, but just wanted to share a system thats worked for me for my entire life. It helps keep track of long term goals while also helping construct my weekly todo lists. I'll also note that a surprising amount of my tasks are just research related (i.e. ""How does my health insurance work"", ""How should I fix my lawn""). 

To add on to this, sometimes I'll reward myself for doing X amount of tasks. If you're a reward motivated person like I am, I highly encourage doing this (i.e. ""I'll buy a board game once I tackle these 10 top priority tasks"")

You can clean the walls and remove stuck/frozen-to-the-wall food splatters without needing to defrost or remove all the food.,"You can skip the all-purpose cleaner, but a detergent is helpful for cleaning the frozen food messes. Use a cleaner you would use to wipe your counters down. Just make sure it isn’t mixed with water so it has a minimal chance to ice up—concentrates really are best!

Also, if you have a dishwasher, take the shelves out and run them through the express cycle.

Dump out your stale/dirty ice and wipe down the ice hopper while you’re in there. If you have a garbage disposal, use the discard ice to clean it! Make sure the baffle is in, dump the ice in your sink, drizzle it with dish soap and carefully, slowly ram it down the disposal using a spoon with a little bit of hot water running. The ice will form an abrasive soapy slush that will leave your disposal very clean… mine is also much quieter after I do this.

As an example; if you have a wheelbarrow full of rocks you want to move, but the wheelbarrow has square wheels, you are going to put a lot of effort into moving the rocks. Using the wheelbarrow is not a bad idea, but if you make adjustments to the wheels, i.e. make them round, you'll be more successful and your effort will be more effective. There is no reason to change the whole wheelbarrow idea, just a slight adjustment will help out.

The same goes for personal improvement. If you have troubles with communication, you don't have to change who you are to communicate better, but make adjustments to how you communicate. Listen more, reflect back what the person said to ensure you understand, acknowledge the other person's view points (not the same as agreeing or disagreeing), or keep away from problem solving.

This was never really a problem persay with my personal life but I have a tendency to over share. And I've learned in my mid 20s people don't need / want to know everything.

It basically is a simple way to evaluate your choices and avoid regret. It works like this: whenever you are faced with a decision, ask yourself how you will feel about it in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years. Then compare your answers and choose the option that aligns best with your long-term goals and values.

For example, if you are tempted to buy something impulsively, ask yourself if you will still be happy with it in 10 minutes (probably yes), 10 months (maybe not), and 10 years (definitely not). This can help you resist the urge and save money for something more meaningful.

The 10-10-10 rule can also help you overcome procrastination, deal with conflicts, and pursue your dreams. It can help you focus on what really matters and avoid wasting time and energy on things that don’t.

Moreover, I have never made a goal in my entire life; all of school was a passive process that never involved me setting up any ""goal"" to achieve, and I never understood the appeal of goals since it seemed so reliant on trying to set a plan for real life, and real life is messy and impossible to predict (e.g. ""Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"" questions to me are meaningless; it's impossible to predict what will happen in the next 6 months, so something that far away seems totally meaningless).

I never had to schedule myself in the goal-oriented mindset I've seen my peers have.

However, I'm worried this might be a potentially major roadblock for me in life, and I don't want to run the risk of falling behind or becoming a loser or anything like that. I just don't know how to want things -- I basically purchase nothing outside of rent/bills, food, and transportation each month despite having expendable income -- or the things I do want seem ambiguous or like there is no way to create an actionable goal (e.g. ""I want to make X amount of new friends in Y months"" seems forced, unnatural, and reliant on unpredictable factors) so much as things that have to happen spontaneously and that are partially outside of my control.

So, how do I even figure out how to have real goals? How does one decide to want things or to make actionable plans to achieve results that one anticipates?",LifeProTips,9,1685384527.0,0.75

People are too vast to calculate their perspective. Its not worth it. In Tao, It would be apart of the chaos and enigma of the ten thousand things you're gonna think about in the day. 
Ultimately, things need to be talked out. You will feel better in the end if you let it out what is bothering. 
In addition, be mindful of how you will present this. If its something that really bothers, take time to make sure you can clearly advocate what is not working for you. 

You will destroy yourself for no reason. The object of your attention wont know or even know why. You will strengthen your relationship when you honestly and openly let others know your boundaries and specific troubles they may inadvertently cause.

LPT - Never Lie At Work and Never Do Things That Will Put You In A Position To Need To Lie To Save Your Job. Eat The S**t Sammich and Move On,"[Caveat this obviously only applies if you work for a decent/good/great company where you won't be forced into a situation with an a-hole boss where you did nothing wrong but need to lie anyways because that's the a-holes MO]

I've worked off and on for my present employer for going on 10 years (I was gone for about 10 years in the middle when I went independent for awhile but decided it wasn't worth the little extra money for a whole lot more stress of owning my own business). From the beginning, I have had a reputation as someone who is both a hard worker, team player and very honest. 

That last part has saved my ass several times. I celebrity client (just realized is dead so I can name them: Olivia Newton John, RIP) called the first year I was with them to complain that I had ""just wandered into my house."" Soon as it was announced to the office, one of the first voices was the point person for client relations who said, ""That doesn't sound like /u/Cinemaphreak. Let's wait until we can hear it from him what exactly happened."" What happened was her nephew invited me into the house which is why I was sitting in her dining room with her two assistants when she walked in wearing her PJs and gasped. Said nephew was about to leave for the airport, so was in the guest room when she asked the assistants ""did either of you invite him in before I could get dressed?""  

Now, while she did later confirm with the nephew that is indeed what transpired, as far as my bosses were concerned the matter was over the moment I finished telling them. Just two days ago it came into play in a minor way when I misremembered a petty cash voucher amount but my rep made the boss get ticked off with the VP because clearly I wasn't trying to steal 10 effing dollars from the company and it was his job to deal instead of refusing to communicate with me because ""I don't make mistakes"" (and yes, a-hole, you do, but don't have an ego small enough to admit it). 

It's also why I am just about the only person at the company who can go to the boss and tell them that a client has told me that they would like to request that I am their person when possible to handle their business (otherwise, employees are expected to tell any client that they need to make the request personally). I was recently granted commission on a client that has been with the company longer than I have been simply because my boss said ""He obviously likes you and stays with us because of it"" (we have no sales staff, all work is either word of mouth or employees bringing clients with them which I have also done). 

But it's been this way at every place I worked. Back when I used to bartend, I quit because I was fed up with getting static from some of the wait staff and also coming up short because someone was getting into my register when I went to the kitchen or stock room. The manager knew this was almost certainly the case and would have me recount repeatedly hoping it was a miscount instead, ""But I can't keep making up the difference, you need to either keep a better eye on your money or catch this asshole so I can fire him"" (we had it down to two waiters, but whoever it was was a good thief). 

The place was owned by the manager's father, who called me at home after I quit and wouldn't return his son's calls as was so done with the place. In his very accented English, ""Why you care about a fucking waiter? We know it's not you. We pay you back until we catch this guy"" (meaning I would keep acting like I was putting the difference back in the til and they would secretly refund it because they knew it was a thief not named me). And yes, I know, under the law I wasn't obligated to make up the difference, but good luck proving that's why you got fired.

Point is, it will not be pleasant when you do have to fess up to your screw-ups and have to eat the s**t sammich of consequences, down the road the reputation for being honest is a rep you literally cannot buy but is near priceless.",LifeProTips,12,1685311759.0,0.62

"LPT: With the cost of vehicles and repair going up, make sure to check that your property damaged liability rates are adjusting to this change.","Hey everyone, I just noticed that I had not changed my property damage liability in probably 10 years. I felt that it was probably not high enough by today's standards. As everybody has probably noticed, car values are highly inflated right now and that includes used vehicles. On top of that we are seeing record prices for car parts and inflated prices for car repairs. Your liability in an at-fault accident is much higher today than it was just years ago. If your insurance does not cover your liability, you may be personally responsible for the remainder. And since I'm saying this to people that carry vehicle insurance, you are probably someone who cares about your credit score and your ability to get low interest loans.  And also remember, accidents can easily become multiple car accidents. Don't just plan for replacing one vehicle, you may be responsible for multiple vehicles.

In short, don't trick yourself into thinking you're covered if your property liability is not high enough to cover the costs of an accident in 2023.",LifeProTips,7,1685309220.0,0.71

"LPT Request: Dealing with Loud Upstairs Neighbors, Unhelpful Apt. MGMT.","I'm at my wits end. My Neighbors above me are horribly loud and leave junk everywhere. I've lived in this apartment I'm in for the last 5 years and have never had neighbors this bad. (in fact, I've lived in several apartments throughout my life and this is my worst experience by a long shot). I live in an expensive town and would rather not relocate because I live super close to work, my rent is cheap for this area due to being grandfathered in, house prices are more ridiculous than the 7% interest rates, and don't want to ""complain too much"" for fear of my landlord retaliating by jacking up my rates to push me out for being ""fussy"", but my complaints are largely fruitless. As of January, Our apartment complex was purchased by a new Management company, and I believe this may have something to do with the lack of action on behalf of the old company, and the new one just seems not to care.

Now, I completely understand living on the first floor comes with a bit of noise from above, but since September of last year, the noise has been ""Living underneath a bowling alley during a tournament"" levels of bad. The Apartment above me is a carbon copy of my 1Br, 500sq foot ""Harry Potter closet"", and yet I see several children, a Mom, a Dad, and a Grandma living there day in and day out. I've been taking note of the date and time of each excessive noise situation, ranging from stomping/jumping and furniture shuffling to multiple WEEKLY knock-down-drag-out screaming arguments Mom has with her children when it's bath time. (Immediately after the shower faucet turns on, a child screams ""No Quiero!"" and get's chased around the apartment by a furious mom). This all happens anywhere from 6:00pm and sometimes continues into the 11:00pm hour, but is most common between 6-9pm, just about every night of the week.

On top of this, my patio is completely unguarded on all sides and daily I come home to trash, Coke & Mentos ""experiments"", toys, scooters, crayons, paint dripped, and Cigarette butts laying around out front. No other first floor apartments in my complex have as much garbage outside their respective areas as I do. I've put in several complaints noting times and dates, along with attached photo evidence of the trash left around to the office via EMail, None of which they've returned or acknowledged. I've walked in to the Leasing office on my days off to follow up and they act genuinely shocked and appalled and have assured me that ""We'll notify them"" but absolutely nothing has changed with the noise, and the garbage I find has only gotten worse. This seems to be the only time I can get direct contact with anyone, as I leave work at 5:00pm and even though the Leasing office hours are stated on the website and door ""Open until 6:00pm"", they are CONSTANTLY Lights-off-and-locked-up by 5:15-5:30.

What do I do? What can I do? (Is there some form of Housing Authority I can Call? I live in Colorado if that matters.) Retaliation is never a wise option, And I'm not looking for them to be evicted, I just want some peace and quiet. Police in my town are so underfunded and spread thin that non-life-threatening traffic accidents are ""cold reported"" by those involved and a noise complaint will basically be unheard. My lease is up for renewal in December and I know they're going to add on their yearly rent-hike, which I plan to contest to the fullest extent possible without getting a lawyer involved. It's gotten so bad that my gaming friends on DISCORD have commented that they hear the stomping and yelling OVER MY HEADSET MICROPHONE! (I play with a headset to allow me to play my game without disturbing anyone else). All I want is peace and quiet. I'm tempted to ask the Local Zoo if they've got an apartment available underneath the Elephant and Rhino Exhibit.

You need to visit the Automatic Payments page on the PayPal website and remove these authorizations. It's actually very simple and fast to do once you know about it.

LPT: It's fledgling season! Here are a few tips in case you come across a baby bird on the ground.,"Ecologist here! It's that time of year again when the ground is covered in baby birds, some should be there and some should not. So here are a few tips so you know when to intervene and when to leave them alone.
  

  
If you find a baby bird on the ground the first thing to do is check for injuries. Baby birds can look pretty weak, but if you don't see any blood or obvious damage then it's fine. If it is injured do not try to take it home and nurse it back to health, birds require specific diets and handling and even most of them don't make it when cared for by their parents let alone an unequipped human. Please call a wildlife rehabber.
  

  
The second thing to check for is age:
  

  
If it hasn't opened its eyes yet and is mostly pink and featherless it's a hatchling (0-3 days old). Hatchlings should not be out of the nest. If you see a hatchling and the nest it fell out of you can try to put it back in (that old wive's tale about birds not taking care of chicks touched by humans is false). If you can't see the nest you can make your own out of a small container lined with soft material then attach it to a tree or bush as high as you can. If it looks like the parents are not caring for it after an hour or so call a local wildlife rehabber to come get the hatchling. If the bird is invasive, a starling or house sparrow for example (invasive in the Americas and other parts of the world, they are native to Europe and important parts of ecosystems in their native range), a lot of rehabbers euthenize them.
  

  
If its eyes are open and it's got a few spikey (pin) feathers it's a nestling (3-13 days old) and also not ready to leave the nest. Please adhere to the advice above about hatchlings.
  

  
If its eyes are open and its fully feathered, hopping around, maybe a little fluffy, short tail, its a fledgling (13+ days old). Leave these cuties alone! They are working on flying and probably exhausted and in need of rest before they take off again. Their parents are around, even if you cannot locate them, and are feeding this little guy or gal. No need to call anyone or do anything unless it is injured. If it is in the street and might get hit by a car you can herd them to the side of the road or under a bush. The parents will find it.
  

  
I know everyone means well and it's hard to look at a baby bird and not want to do anything. But you only need to worry about the hatchlings and nestlings or an injured fledgling.
  

  
Quick Note - Some birds are ground nesters so they will be on the ground no matter what, but the chances of you finding a ground nesting bird is not very high. If you're in the U.S. Killdeer, ovenbirds, bobolinks, swans, ducks, geese, etc. all nest on the ground and their chicks will be there in all their forms. Shorebirds also nest on the ground, so if you're at the beach you'll see plover, sanderlings, and other wading birds. This post is really for folks finding non-ground nesting birds in urban and suburban areas.",LifeProTips,1974,1685021300.0,0.97
"LPT: If you're a male office worker, don't buy short-sleeved business shirts.","Instead, buy all long-sleeved business shirts, then roll up the sleeves when it's warm. Reasons:

1. Yes, this is subjective, but to a large number of people, short-sleeved business shirts just don't look as professional. They are generally a looser, less tailored fit. How many high-powered, successful businessmen do you see wearing them?

2. A large number of women greatly admire/ go nuts over the look of men with rolled up sleeves, and will say as much in every forum they can. If that's the attention you are after, take note.

3. You can save money (or alternatively, spend the same amount of money but get more or higher quality clothing) if you don't have to buy two different styles of shirt for different seasons.

Bonus LPT: If it's a warm day and you know you'll need your sleeves rolled up from the start, you can save time and effort by rolling the sleeves before putting the shirt on.

It is a good idea if you have a friend/family member/etc to help! 

Here are things I did/wish I knew when I started 

What I Did: 
1) Compare costs of different services. 

What I Wish I Knew:

1) Larger moving boxes ship for about the same amount of money as a medium box. Large boxes hurt a little more but stick with them. 
2) Don’t pack the stuff you use the least first. Start with the things that you like/use. Be creative. 
Just in case you make a mistake and go over budget.

Xfinity 10Gig Network, is it Worth it or not?

I've been in IT for 12 years.

I keep seeing xfinity ad for a 10Gig network.

Truth: I don't own one PC or phone or device that could utilize a 10G network, the hardware I own isn't capable of those speeds. Even my gaming pc has a wired adapter designed to max out at 1Gig. Wifi - no device I own is capable of 10 gigs. Not even my access point can run 10 G, theoretically it could do 9.6 gbps ...in theory. But all your devices would need to be wifi 6 compatible. 

It's a scam and beyond what a house would ever need.

I've got fiber at my house 500 download, 500 upload, that's the lowest fiber plan, if they offered 300/300 or even 150/150 I would buy it. 

There's no need for crazy download speeds for surfing and streaming.

The only time I notice I have fiber is when downloading large files. 

I use to work at a 90 person IT company, we had fiber limited to 100mbps. If that doesn't tell you the secret to internet idk what else would.",LifeProTips,4,1685066177.0,0.7
LPT Online clothes shopping,"I have two tips for when clothes shopping online which as a person who hates public changing rooms have helped.

* Use the sizing guide from a brand you like and know fits you well to compare with new brands, this helps you purchase the right size for you and reduces the chances of needing to return or exchange.

Remember clothing is meant to fit you not you fit clothing and there is no uniform sizing measurement across brands so don't stress the numbers as who is going to see the size on the label.

* Cut open the bag with scissors so you can use it for returns or exchanges to save trying to find packaging, just turn it inside out to hide the shipping label previously used.

LPT: No one wants to hear you monologue,"Whether in a group setting or 1 on 1. 

This isn’t a PSA for your typical social butterfly or extrovert with healthy communication skills.

I have come across many people who like to talk at length uninterrupted and won’t give an inch to get a word in unless it’s a co-sign to something they previously said. And in the rare instances where they do give you a chance to breathe new life into the conversation they gloss over whatever you said, not giving it much thought, if any, and continue to speak a mile a minute expecting you to nod along as you hang on their every word.

I mean this in the nicest way possible; outside of a public speaking situation, it doesn’t matter what you’re saying, who it is said to, how much you love them, or they love you…no one alive is trying to hear you talk for 5+ minutes straight. It’s an audiobook they didn’t willingly press play on and now they’re presented with the dilemma of hurting a friend by walking away/telling them they’re bored of the topic or being held hostage as a sounding board.

That is not talking *to* someone, that is talking *at* someone. People around you will take notice & slowly but surely lose interest in conversing with you. When you truly value the people in your life, you value their thoughts, emotions and opinions too. When you don’t make an effort to do so, they start to question their relationship with you. And not just romantic relationships; this goes for friends, family, even coworkers too. 

We all have thoughts, emotions, dreams and experiences we’d like to share or get more clarity on. Don’t monopolize anyone’s time & emotional energy getting yours out without having the basic human decency to return the favor, it’s not conducive to quality relationships.

&#x200B;

• Say please and thank you. The words you say matters.

• Try to be kind. Kindness is so rare in life. And don’t take advantage of the kindness of others.

• Treat the ones you love the best. Never stop reminding them that they matter to you. Whenever possible, put them first.

• Don’t be prideful. There is no gain to be made by being prideful. You can have pride in yourself or your achievements, but try not to be prideful.

• Be humble. Humility is a facet of kindness.

• When you’re hurting, don’t lash out at the people around you.

• Read daily. Read a newspaper. Read a magazine. Read ten pages of a book you hate. Over time, you will be amazed at how much knowledge you’ve amassed.

• Don’t let anyone walk over you. Stand firm in your convictions.

• See the best in people, and tell them about their qualities.

• Don’t lie, cheat and steal. What you gain will cause others pain.

• Protect the vulnerable, no matter how weak you think you are.

• Honor and appreciate your parents, spouse, siblings, friends and those who help you. Don’t take anyone for granted.

• Apologize freely when you make mistakes. Be sincere when you say sorry. Let people be angry at you if they need to.

• Forgive. Don’t hold grudges. But don’t forget.

• Work hard. Earn your keep. Don’t feel entitled on the generosity of others.

• Never stop learning new things. Nothing is ever too small or too big to learn. Learn the name of a star constellation. Learn how to fold clothes. Learn how to repair a washing machine. Learn how to speak another language. Learn how to cook a simple dish.

• Surround yourself with good people. You will aspire to be a better person by having good people around you.

• Be friends with painters and sculptors – they usually see the beauty in life. Be friends with bookworms – they are usually patient and idealistic. Make friends with actors, musicians and dancers – they usually love the best. Be friends with people who are funny and have a good, sincere laugh – they will make your world brighter.

• Be friends with the cleaners, gardeners, security guards, cashiers, etc. Ask their names, ask about their day. They have a hard life. Make them feel better. Let them know you care.

Cold + vitamin E right away is my go to now, always good to keep a bottle on hand for emergencies imo. Have also had good results with mixing in collagen powder and rubbing both in for a few hours, skin is made of collagen, vitamin E creates new skin growth/barrier, cold prevents the inflammatory response and from residual heat causing further damage.

"LPT: If you want to avoid that awkward silence or “I’m sorry” when someone tells you that a person in their life has passed away, don’t be afraid to ask questions","A quick note; if the person you’re talking to shows signs of not wanting to discuss the event further than what happened, don’t pry!! This is strictly for those who know they have the other person’s consent/comfort when discussing the subject. Feel free to preface questions with “if you’re comfortable/okay with telling me…”

4 years ago (gonna be 5 later this year), my sister suddenly passed away. It was the first time I’d ever have to deal with a death that didn’t involve a pet or a distant relative, plus I was quite young and, at the time, had no real social life outside of my immediate family and abusive partner so I did not have the experience, knowledge, or support in order to cope with the event properly. Thankfully over time, I attended some group and 1-on-1 therapy sessions that helped manage the my thoughts on the event. I can confidently say I’ve learned a lot about death and am not as afraid of the subject.

Considering the amount of time that has passed since my sister died, I’ve had many encounters with other people telling me about their friends or family that have passed. Whether it be their grandmother, close friend, or father, I tend to ask the same questions.

“How do you feel about all of this?”

“How was your relationship with them?”

“What were they like?”

If there’s one thing that I’ve learned over the past 4+ years, it’s that despite the absence and pain, all grief is rooted in love. People don’t miss the things they don’t love. It’s not going to fix everything or reverse the effects of what happened, but being able to talk about whoever you are grieving allows for the opportunity for that love to be put somewhere and shared. 

If anything, I wish I had more chances to talk about my sister. I usually don’t bring her up out of nowhere. I would give anything to tell somebody about all the influence she has over my younger years,, and just how killer her homemade sourdough bread was. So I hope this allots for more open conversation between people and to let the legacies of love live on.",LifeProTips,1694,1684830478.0,0.95

LPT: Learn the most basic elements of critical evaluation.,"With the rise of social media, disinformation is in constant use as a means to control narratives, whether this be by a nation-state, a politician, a con-artist or grifter, or simply two people having what should be a fleeting private dispute.  
  
However, 99% of these attempts to mislead are easy to spot with some simple objective thinking, so if you've ever felt misled by the original narrative to a social media story until new evidence came to light, consider applying the below thought process.  
  
1) If you are being presented with a video as evidence, don't believe the story as presented to you. Simply see the evidence for yourself and make no assumptions.  
  
2) Ask yourself who is taking the video? Is it CCTV? a completely neutral third party, or is it one of the parties to the dispute themselves or one of their friends? Don't presume that the person recording the video wouldn't unintentionally record evidence of them doing wrong - it happens all the time, just look at those 'prank' bros.  
  
3) When does the video start and when does it end? Are there any breaks in the video evidence being presented to you? Do you see for yourself what started the dispute or is that just being presented to you by text or speech?  
  
4) These kinds of posts are often presented to us as identifiable story tropes that we are familiar with and have automatic sympathy towards one side and antipathy towards the other. For example, the bullied victim finally hitting back, the racism victim exposing the racist, a thief being caught and beat, etc. Ask yourself, do you see any of what's being accused, or just the 'response'?

5) How much do you want to believe the narrative is true yourself? Is this influencing how quick you might be to believe one side over the other?

6) Remember that being physically threatened will often make people back down, whether they are in the right or wrong. Equally, the threat of being 'exposed' via video on a mass scale, whether true or not, is an incredibly powerful threat. Remember, backing down is not evidence of guilt, neither is not backing down.

7) Place yourself in the shoes of either side of the dispute, how would you honestly react in their position?  How would someone react if they had less composure and control than you? Someone getting angry, upset, scared or even aggressive is not evidence of guilt, neither are the lack of these reactions.

8) Finally, ask yourself, does the situation as presented to you, pass the common sense test? Just how realistic and likely is this to ever happen? Don't let your own biases allow you to be misled.",LifeProTips,19,1684844064.0,0.85

"LPT: Agreeing as a family to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, and ""family member days"" (example: ""Mother's"" Day) on a different day that's close to the actual one can really de-stress things and make them more relaxed.","Our family has benefited from doing this on the following weekend, even if a full week out. There's a few reasons why it really works for us, and perhaps some apply to others.

\- For people who have 9-5 weekday work or school/after-school activities, the weekends are simply easier. Holding the event then can remove a lot of the rushed feeling of trying to celebrate something after getting home on a weekday.

\- For annual events like Mom's Day, you can go out to a restaurant for the occasion and it won't usually be nearly as crowded with others celebrating that occasion.

\- If the subject of the holiday has other family members that want to celebrate too, for example a mother with several adult kids living locally, this allows that member to get two separate days rather than one overloaded one. For us this is a biggie, as our aging mom tires quickly.

There are some possible drawbacks. Some people want their celebration to be on ""the day of"", rather than later. We manage this ourselves by ensuring to send the person a happy-day message on the ""actual day"", and include a reminder that the real party will be later. 

And, there's the running joke of us accusing each other of going cheap on the Valentine's Day flowers or Easter candy by buying it at half price clearance.  But, hey, what's a few wilted petals between happy family members anyway? :0)",LifeProTips,1546,1684601014.0,0.96

"LPT: Be cautious buying a grill during a summer holiday sale. They're often cheaper grills designed to sell for a tidy profit at the ""sale"" price, just like Black Friday ""doorbusters""","I used to do grill assembly for a large retailer. Every big summer holiday like Memorial Day, there would be a big sale on grills. But it wasn’t the reliable models you would find on display year round. They would ship in dozens of grills I had never seen before, same brand but a different design. On paper, they would be good deals. The aesthetics would be nicer than the regular grills, with pleasing curves and fun colors. And they would have the same number of burners as a more expensive grill they normally sold, plus a couple “extra features” to make them seem like a better value than the non-sale grill that was significantly more expensive. Y’know, because of the sale. Wink. If it was selling for $150, the in-store signage wouldn’t say “regular price $275,” but rather “compare at $275.”

But they were the worst grills to put together. They would be so flimsy, the “extra features” were always fiddly and fragile, there would be issues like doors misaligned, I was often afraid to move them since they were so fragile, and occasionally there would be manufacturing issues across the entire line. Whatever the sale price was, those grills were designed from the ground up to turn a healthy profit at that “discount.”

Check reviews and model numbers. If you're shopping in person, move the grill around the ground like you were moving it from the garage to the yard and see how sturdy it feels. Be suspicious about extra bells and whistles and think hard whether they actually would add value to your grilling experience.",LifeProTips,6,1684691834.0,0.87

Ofcourse, you have to do it when you want a job change, but there's no reason to stop looking anytime.

Edit1: For people having concerns regarding job hunting, it doesn't have to take much time if you're not looking actively. I use LinkedIn about 20 to 30 mins regularly. I've built my network in HRs and senior managers in industry. I connect with people who were alums from college or same company\hobby, if I see some interesting project they posted about etc. Just a few words exchanged every now and then. Even if you just wish them on their birthdays, work anniversary etc. And I post roughly monthly or even less. So if there's an opening they post about, I get to know automatically or if they search, I'm one of the top search result.

Edit2: People seem to consider offer in terms of pay only. I meant offer as in proposition in its entirety. It's everything they offer including environment, growth etc or whatever matters to you. Since you're casually looking, you can talk to people in the company and get to know these things. The idea is this. If you're satisfied, simply more money will obviously not attract you. You will reject a lot of offers. But WHEN you accept one, it's guaranteed to be better. And you can demand for more. Afford to lose the negotiation.",LifeProTips,2431,1684527876.0,0.89

"LPT: If you find yourself getting ""stuck"" on one or 2 items in the store and want to break that habit, take the bus to the store/back.","This is assuming you can nicely align the bus schedule to your shopping time, and if your area has public transit. I was able to do this and it helped tremendously so I figured I'd share it here.

Taking public transit is a smart move if you want to avoid getting stuck on one item in a store. If you miss the bus, you're pretty much out of luck, which means you better get your stuff and get out.  
  
Using public transportation adds a sense of urgency to your shopping experience. When you're relying on buses or trains, time becomes a precious commodity. If you miss your bus, you'll have to wait for the next one, which can mess up your schedule and inconvenience others. That's why you'll naturally feel motivated to make quick decisions and not linger around fixating on a single item. You'll find yourself making more efficient choices, grabbing what you need, and moving on.  
  
Moreover, the limited schedule of public transit pushes you to prioritize your shopping needs. You know you have to catch a specific bus or train, and that puts a ticking clock on your shopping trip. It forces you to think about what's truly important and make your purchases accordingly. No more wasting time endlessly debating whether you really need that one item. Public transit encourages you to be decisive, get your essentials, and head on your way.  
  
So, if you want to avoid getting caught up on a single item and make the most of your time, taking public transit is the way to go. Remember, if you miss that bus, you're in a bit of a jam, so grab your stuff and make a swift exit.

You might be thinking, ""Just drive then you won't have a sense of urgency and there's 0 risk of missing anything"". Remember, the LPT is about not getting stuck on 1 item. Again, this helped me, you might find it helpful too.",LifeProTips,0,1684709276.0,0.17
